# Using Datashare to analyse documents

Datashare is a tool for analysing documents created by the ICIJ. It allows you to:

* Search multiple documents all at once (document database/archive)
* Text extraction (OCR)
* Entity extraction

First, [download Datashare here](https://datashare.icij.org/).

A [user guide explains how to install the tool on various platforms](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/) and there are sections on [analysis](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/all/analyze-documents) and [exploration](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/all/explore-documents).

Those guides are best to check, but here's a quick step-by-step.

## Add documents to your Datashare folder

Once Datashare is installed, it will create a folder on your computer with the same name. On a Windows PC this will be on your Desktop; on a Mac it will be in your username folder, as [explained here](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/mac/add-documents-to-datashare-on-mac).

To analyse documents in Datashare you need to first move them to this folder.
