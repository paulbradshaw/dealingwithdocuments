"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a very strict lockdown for the United Kingdom, saying British people should only leave home for basic necessities. The UK is closing all shops selling nonessential goods, and all gatherings of more than 2 people will be stopped. Read the full transcript here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (00:16);Good evening. The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades, and this country is not alone. All over the world, we’re seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. Tonight, I want to update you on the latest steps we’re taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (00:43);Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment where no health service in the world could possibly cope, because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. As we’ve seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic healthcare systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it, meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope and save more lives. That’s why we’ve been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. Though huge numbers are complying, and I thank you all, the time has now come for us all to do more."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (01:56);From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at home, because the critical thing we must do to stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: Shopping for basic necessities as infrequently as possible, one form of exercise a day, for example, a run, walk, or cycle alone or with members of your household, any medical need to provide care or to help a vulnerable person, and traveling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all. These are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine, and you should do this as little as you can and use food delivery services where you can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (03:12);If you don’t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and disbursing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronics stores and other premises, including libraries, playgrounds, and outdoor gyms and places of worship. We’ll stop all gatherings of more than two people in public, excluding people you live with. And we’ll stop all social events including weddings, baptisms, and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (04:05);No prime minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses, and to their jobs. That’s why we’ve produced a huge and unprecedented program of support, both for workers and for business. I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. But at present, there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (04:52);And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day-by-day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7,500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy, by simply staying at home, we are increasing our stocks of equipment, we are accelerating our search for treatments, we’re pioneering work on a vaccine, and we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-announces-uk-lockdown-you-must-stay-at-home","Boris Johnson: (05:25);I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus, everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers, to the carers, to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight, we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease, to protect our NHS, and to save many, many thousands of lives. I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge, and we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus, and we will beat it together. Therefore, I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS, and save lives. Thank you."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson on March 22 warned that an Italy-style lockdown was possible for the UK, and gave further COVID-19 updates. Read the full transcript of the briefing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (01:54);Good afternoon everybody and thank you for coming again. I want to thank Robert Jenrick the community secretary and of course Dr. Jenny Harris, the deputy chief medical officer. And I want to thank everybody in the country today for the whole effort that we are collectively making. I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, food distribution, transport, you name it. Absolutely everybody who is keeping this country going today. And I want to thank everyone who is being forced of course to do something differently today. Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for mother’s day but FaceTime them, has rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did. Everybody who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business, bar, they could have done fantastic business on a great day like this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (02:58);Thank you for your sacrifice. I know how tough it must be. And I can tell you once again that this government will be standing behind you, behind British business, behind British workers, employees, the self employed throughout this crisis. And the reason we’re taking these unprecedented steps both to prop up businesses, support business, support our economy and these preventative measures is of course that we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives. And today we’ve come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we now have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable. And you remember that I said the moment would come when we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about one and a half million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (04:06);But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. And that is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease. And I want to say just a couple of other things. We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it’s crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed and tomorrow you shouldn’t send your child to school unless you’ve been identified as a key worker. And more generally in view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures that we have set out. I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors. And of course I want, of course I do, people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves. It’s crucial for health, for mental and physical wellbeing, but please follow the advice."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (05:20);And don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity. You have to stay two meters apart. You have to follow the social distancing advice. And even if you think that you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people that you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk. And I say this now on Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, and take this advice seriously. Follow it because it’s absolutely crucial. And as I’ve said throughout this process, we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review. And yes, of course we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (06:15);So, always remember in following this advice. I know how difficult it is. But always remember that each and every one of us, you are doing your bit in following this advice. You’re doing your bit to slow the spread of the disease. And the more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this, and always remember we will get through this and we will beat it together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (06:50);So, next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures that we’re going to be bringing forward in the next few days. Robert."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (07:00);Well, thank you prime minister and good afternoon. As a nation, we’re confronted with the need to make big changes and enormous sacrifices to our daily lives. And this is especially true today on mother’s day when many of us would want nothing more than to be at home with our loved ones in person. But in recent weeks, heroic workers in the NHS, in social care, our public services in local government and many others have been shouldering the country’s burden. And I think we owe it to them and to the most vulnerable in society to stay at home, to protect the NHS, and by doing this, to save lives. And as the prime minister said, our response from the outset to the virus has been guided by scientific evidence. And our action plan set out the interventions that would be required to be deployed at the right time. And so today we have to go further and shield the most clinically vulnerable people to help save their lives. Following the chief medical officer’s guidance, the NHS has identified up to one and a half million people in England who face the highest risk of being hospitalized by the virus. The NHS will be contacting these people in the coming days urging them to stay at home for a period of at least 12 weeks. I know that many people will want to know whether this applies to them. This will include people who are living with severe respiratory conditions, specific cancers such as of the blood or bone marrow, those who received organ transplants and some though not all of those receiving certain types of immunosuppressant drug treatments. The full list of conditions is now online at gov.uk/coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (09:07);Now, I don’t underestimate what we’re asking of people. It will be tough, but if you are one of these people, I want to reassure you on behalf of the government that you’re not alone you. We will be with you throughout to support you. And let me set out what we’re doing and how it’s going to work. This week, the NHS will contact people by letter identified as being of higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. This will also be followed up where possible by text and by phone call. We’ll be asking these people not to leave home at all to avoid face to face contact for 12 weeks or to protect themselves. I know people will worry about what this means for family members and for carers, for those without family and friends and neighbors close by. They’ll worry about how they’ll be able to receive medicines and essential supplies. And I know people will feel anxious about supporting their mental health as well as their physical health. So let me address those concerns."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (10:22);Others in the household will not be required to adopt these protective shielding measures for themselves. However, they must follow the public health England guidance on social distancing. Carers, both formal and informal can continue to visit, but again, they must follow the additional measures set out by public health England. For people who do not have support in place around them, who don’t have a network of family and friends close by, we will be creating a network of local hubs covering the whole country. This will require a major national effort in a very short period of time. Medicines will be delivered by community pharmacists. Groceries, and essential household items will be delivered by local councils and food distributors working with supermarkets to ensure that nobody needs to worry about getting the food and essential items that they’ll need. These parcels will be left on the doorstep."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (11:32);The government, the food industry, community pharmacists, local councils, and emergency services are working round the clock to get this scheme off the ground. Members of the armed forces already supporting this effort. Including some of the finest military planners in the world. The prime minister and I are very grateful to everybody who’s been involved and will be involved playing their part in making this happen. I know that many people watching at home will want to volunteer-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (12:03);I know that many people watching at home will want to volunteer once the service is established. There will be opportunities and everybody can contribute in different ways. In every city, in every town and village, there’s a huge amount of work to be done and each of us has the power to do it. We need to remember our neighbors when we shop, we need to pick up the phone for a chat with loved ones. We need to display small acts of kindness, of thoughtfulness, of love and compassion."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (12:37);This will be a very worrying time for people with these health conditions. But whilst more people will be required to be by themselves at home and that’s difficult, let’s guarantee that they are never alone. And when all of this is done, that we emerge as better neighbors to each other, as stronger communities and that we are all proud of the part that we played in this effort. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (13:09);Thanks Robert. Jenny, is there anything you want to add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (13:11);I think perhaps just to add three things, I’m sure there’ll be some questions and I’m happy to answer those. I think first of all, just to highlight, this is a hugely complex task clinically to identify these individuals. Clearly we’re asking them to take themselves out of society for 12 weeks and that is no small ask and the measures that you’ve just heard recognize that difficult balance. In doing that, we have worked with the Royal College of General Practitioners, with NHS digital, with the medical rural colleges and with secondary care clinicians as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (13:46);And I just want to offer my thanks to them and they will continue to work with us over the next week or two while we refine the individual lists. I think the second point was just to note that for any of the public listing who might be in this group, because we want to be as inclusive as possible, we may actually slightly overestimate the number of individuals and there will be opportunity to discuss in due course their individual conditions going forward."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (14:17);So it is possible that an individual might, for example, receive a letter which has been digitally constructed because that is the quickest way to identify individuals. But we recognize also that the person at the end of the digital number is an individual living their lives and their condition changes on a regular basis. So it may be that somebody will receive a letter from the clinic as well. This is part of the plan to ensure that we contact all of those who need to be in this group."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (14:47);And then I think the final point I just wanted to make is whilst we’re asking these individuals to be isolated very firmly, many of them have very, very complex conditions or they not be in this group. And I just want to assure them that the normal services which they have from conditions or from other care systems will continue. And on an individual basis, they will either receive care at home through more virtual means, where that’s appropriate or arrangements will be made to bring them safely into clinical areas where they can be managed. So they should not worry that their care will continue. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (15:25);Thanks very much. Jenny. Let’s go to some questions now please. Vicki Young, BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Vicki Young: (15:32);Prime minister, you’ve said that we’re two to three weeks behind Italy in a newspaper article and that we need to make a national collective effort to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. At the moment that you’re still advising people to follow these measures rather than imposing them and I just wondered what evidence you’re basing that on given that it’s clear that some people aren’t listening. And just a quick question on the courts, they’re still going to be open tomorrow. Why is that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (16:00);First on the courts quickly, Vicki. Many courts are already using video trials using a remote technology to do their business, but we’re keeping that under constant review. And on your general point about where we are in the balance of prohibition and allowing people to enjoy themselves outside. Let’s be absolute here, we’ve already taken some very, very draconian steps. We’ve closed the schools where we’ve closed a huge swath of the UK economy, bars, pubs, restaurants, theaters, gyms, and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (16:37);A huge quantity of our normal daily life has been totally transformed. It is very important for people’s mental and physical wellbeing that they should be able to get out and exercise if they possibly can. And many, many people do not have access, let’s face it, to private green space where they can do that. And that’s why parks, open spaces are so absolutely crucial for our country and for our society. But when we do that, we have to do it responsibly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (17:11);And so our message to people, the message that I want to get over tonight, because we’ve all seen how people have been enjoying themselves over a beautiful weekend. My message is, you’ve got to do this in line with the advice. You’ve got to follow the social distancing rule. Keep two meters apart. Otherwise, if you don’t do it responsibility, people don’t exercise responsibly in the parks and green spaces then Vicki as you suggest, there is going to be no doubt that we will have to bring forward further measures and we are certainly keeping that under constant review. Sam Coates, Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Sam Coates: (17:51);Sam Coates, Sky News. Robert Jenrick, you’re going to be asking a one and a half million people to do something completely unprecedented. I just want to ask a little bit about the practicalities of what you’re talking about. First of all, are you saying that there is a government guarantee, local government, national government that anybody who needs food and needs medicine will be supplied it in this group?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Sam Coates: (18:14);What can people expect? Will they get a telephone number to call when they get this letter? Who do they let know that they’ve run out of things? How will it work on a practical level and are you relying on the state or are you relying on effectively the big society which risks gaps opening up? Prime minister, I am confused by government guidance. I want to focus in on one example again, which is playgrounds."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Sam Coates: (18:40);So Sadiq Khan says, don’t go out unless absolutely necessary. You got a stay at home on your podium there. The community secretary on the telly this morning said you can go to playgrounds providing children distance themselves from one another. Have you ever taken a child to a playground and successfully convinced a five-year-old to stay two meters away from another five-year-old on a piece of equipment?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Sam Coates: (19:07);Isn’t there a reason why Ireland closed their playgrounds? And doesn’t this show how people are taking mixed messages away from what you’re saying? And deputy chief medical officer, the graphs showing that the UK has more deaths at this stage than Italy are terrifying. Is there anything that you can say for people looking at those numbers and worrying?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (19:34);You’ll go."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (19:34);Yeah, prime minister. Well, the NHS will be writing to 1.5 million people. These letters should start to land on individuals’ doormats from Tuesday of this coming week. The letter will give a website and a phone number and those will be live by the time the individuals receive the letters. They’ll be able to use those services to alert us if they feel they don’t have family, friends, neighbors and existing support network to help them to get the medicines, the food and other supplies that they need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (20:07);We imagine a very large number of people will have already the support network around them. This service is specifically designed to step in for those people who don’t have that, who are isolated and who will need our support as a government and as a society. We’re going to then be working with local councils who’ve already set up their hubs with the support of the armed forces to ensure this a very well organized mission logistically, and then we’re working with supermarkets and national food distributors to get the product, the food and supplies to their homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (20:40);And as I say, we hope that we’ll be having the first parcels arriving towards the end of next week if individuals need them to that timetable. I don’t underestimate how difficult this is as a challenge. Nobody’s tried to do this before and so it is going take time and we hope that people will bear with us and this will be an iterative process. The first food parcels will inevitably be fairly generic, although we will take obviously account to people’s medical and dietary requirements. In time, we hope to refine this into a more sophisticated product which is better for people and better responds to their individual needs."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (21:18);Thanks Robert. And just Sam, remember while we’ve been trying to listen as absolutely scrupulously to the scientific and medical devices and what they’ve always said so far is that the health benefits for the whole of society of keeping the parks open and the playgrounds open if we possibly can, outweigh the epidemiological value of closing them. But of course, looking at the way people behave, at the way they are responding, we keep that under constant constant review."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (21:55);And if people can’t make use of parks and playgrounds responsibly, you make a very good point about kids. But if they can’t do it in a way that observes the two meter rule, then of course we’re going to have to look at further measures. And the general principle should be that we should all, as far as we possibly can, stay home, protect our NHS and thereby save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (22:27);So responding to your comments about the number of deaths, I mean, obviously any death is a sad event and it’s really difficult for us to, I think, contemplate the fact that we will have many more in this country just as we have seen in other countries. We are expecting that. The actions today particularly are focused precisely on avoiding those additional deaths. That is the main purpose of the shielding task. Not the reduction in numbers, but the reduction in deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (22:58);So I think it makes it even more important that we’re taking this action. But I think there is a general count, which I’ve alluded to before in expectation about numbers. Because when you start counting deaths and the percentage, I’ve just done a very quick sum, while I was doing this about what our current position is. And I think if you calculated Italy’s case fatality rate now is about 10% and ours is four. Actually, we think overall, and we still think that it should be about 1%."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (23:27);And what both of these numbers demonstrate is that the numbers that you get change throughout the course of an epidemic and it changes very much on how you count the cases as well. So as you go through a very sharp rise in numbers, which we will see going forward, you have to be careful not to be comparing to precisely because at the moment in this country, we are counting the most significant disease and it will look as if our case rates, our death rates are actually increasing. We know that is what will happen. So it’s…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (24:03);Right, so we’re actually increasing. We know that is what will happen. So it’s really just a reminder to say we will look back in due course sadly and see the true number of people who have died from coronavirus, but a direct comparison with another country and against individual numbers is something that we should be very cautious of as we go through the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (24:22);Thanks, Jenny. Jess Savage, ITV. Jess."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jess Savage: (24:25);Hello, thank you Prime Minister. Thank you. In speaking about social distancing and the two meter rule that you’ve spoken about, it’s very obvious from a lot of the images that we’re seeing across this weekend that a lot of people are not adhering to that. And you’ve spoken about further measures potentially being introduced. Could you explain to us what you think those further measures might be and when you would consider Implementing them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jess Savage: (24:52);And also ITV News has heard from one doctor who says that her hospital is already running out of ventilators and that people as young as in their 30s and 40s are waiting to get into intensive care and that she fears they may in fact die before they’re treated. So do you believe there are enough ventilators? And how fast are hospitals going to get more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (25:15);Well, first of all, Jess, on ventilators, we have, we think, a good supply at the moment, but we need to get far, far more. You’re absolutely right. And that’s why there’s a huge national effort to equip ourselves, not just with ventilators, but with all the testing kits, the reagents, all the stuff that we’re going to need to beat this disease and we will. But I’ll ask Jenny to say a bit more about the particular hospital that you mentioned and the threat that was… I’m not aware of that particular issue."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (25:50);On social distancing and the further measures that we may bring in. Well, I don’t think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go. And we will think about this very, very actively in the next 24 hours. We need to think about the measures that we’ve seen elsewhere, other countries that are being forced to bring in restrictions on people’s movements all together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (26:16);Now, as I say, I don’t want to do that because I’ve tried to explain the public health benefits, the benefits to people’s mental and physical wellbeing, in the sense that you can go out and it’s so important that pleasure and that ability is preserved, but it can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another in social distancing. I know it’s hard, but that’s the best way forward. If we can’t do that, then yep. I’m afraid we’re going to have to bring forward tougher measures. But Jenny, do you want to say something particularity about the ventilators? Because, I’m not-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (27:00);Yes. I wasn’t actually going to refer specifically to a hospital, but I think just to say, so I think we’re all very aware that London currently, and a few other places, are starting to see very significant rises. We knew this would happen. It’s not what we want to happen, but we know that will happen. So the flexing of the system is designed to manage some of these bumps, if you like, where we get a high throughput of patients requiring ventilation."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (27:27);We monitor beds all the time. The data I have here says that in England, only 12% of adult critical care beds are currently occupied with COVID patients. That will change drastically as we go through the epidemic. But I’m also aware that all hospitals have been asked to step up their training. So on a personal basis, I have a junior doctor in my family, I know she was doing ventilator training on Friday. So there are a number of approaches to which, if we’re looking at what we might say was a standard ventilator bed, what we, if you were in a hospital, you would see routinely is that that is the capacity. There are flex plans sitting behind that to boost them using additional support. So I think we are not in a position where the country at the moment does not have sufficient ventilator capacity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (28:18);Thank you. There we’re working very hard to gt it, to massively to increase it. Be of no doubt about that. Chris Smith, the Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Chris Smith: (28:29);Thank you. Firstly, to Dr. Harris, on the shielding plans. How confident can we be that the NHS is going to identify the right people [inaudible 00:28:39] databases are not sophisticated enough to do this? A lot people are going to fall through the net or be wired unnecessarily. And also what thought has been given the demands you’re placing on people, isolating themselves for an open ended period of time, that the mental health toll of this is not itself going to be quite dangerous for them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Chris Smith: (28:55);And to the Prime Minister, you said we’re two weeks behind Italy, two weeks ago tomorrow, Italy imposed a lockdown. You’ve hinted today that you are thinking of that, but given where we are in the epidemic, if not now, then when?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (29:07);[crosstalk 00:29:11]. Shall I start?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (29:12);Let me just say on, again, just taking Jenny’s earlier points about the difficulties of comparison between countries, but what we are trying to do is to push down on that growth curve and to get our NHS ready. What we don’t know is the effect that the measures we have already taken, we don’t know at this stage whether the measures we took 10 days ago, a week ago, so on, whether their starting to have an effect. And that’s the thing that’s incalculable at the moment. But we can’t obviously take any risks with that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (29:57);And when you say if not now, when is the moment? The answer is always to be guided by the science. And there’s a point that I think people intuitively understand about the timing of these measures. You’ve got to impose these interventions in the spread of the epidemic, at the moment when they can have the maximum effect. And after all, when the epidemic is hardly spreading at all, that’s not the moment to impose curfews and prohibitions on movement and so on and so on. You’ve got to wait until, alas, until it’s the right moment to do it. And that’s always been how we’ve been guided."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (30:39);So for instance, in the measure that we’re announcing today on shielding, I think I made it clear right at the beginning, if you were there at the beginning, that we wouldn’t bring in shielding, which is the moment of maximum protection, and as you say psychologically quite taxing for elderly people, we wouldn’t bring that moment in until it coincided with their moment of maximum exposure to the disease. So you try and make the two things coincide."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (31:10);And we will do absolutely everything in accordance with the advice that we get from Sage, from the CMO, from the CSA, about when our measures can have the maximum impact in stopping the spread of the disease. But basically what people need to understand today, is that that best bet to stop the spreading of the disease, protect our NHS, save lives, is stay at home if you possibly can. Stay at home if you possibly can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (31:43);I’ll work in reverse if that’s all right. I think you mentioned the mental health issues, which are actually were recognized, as the Prime Minister said, if we’re asking people to stay away broadly from others for 12 weeks, that’s quite a large ask of people. It is obviously for their own protection and many of them will be able to self identify, but I’ll come back to that. For mental health, the letter that they will receive will direct them to Every Mind Matters and to the NHS Mental Health and Wellbeing Websites."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (32:12);Now we recognize that a number of people, these are people of all ages. Obviously people perhaps if they’re older will not be as familiar with that and that’s exactly the purpose of the hubs to ensure that there is a safety net behind so that if somebody has psychological needs as well as a general daily living needs or a clinical need, they have a support system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (32:34);And I suspect what is likely to happen is local authorities know their communities really well. They know where their vulnerable individuals are, for whatever it be, whether it be clinical need or a social one and they’ll make that connection and the individual will be able to support. Some will need very little support at all. They’ll have families who can help them. But clearly it’s the most vulnerable that we need to. So that is very well recognized. It’s written within the guidance and it will come through the hubs."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (33:04);On the issue of identification. You are right, it is a hugely complex task. These diseases are not common. 1.5 million sounds a large number, but it’s actually a very small proportion of the population and they are spread across a number of different clinical specialties. So we have approached it by three or four different routes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (33:25);So the first one is, as I said, through a digital route, but we absolutely recognize that that will not pick up, for example, every individual with a condition who is having a particular immunosuppressive treatment [inaudible 00:33:39] being provided maybe not by their GP but by a hospital specialist."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (33:43);So we’ve gone down four different routes, one through that digital element, one through the clinical reference groups who do much of these specialized health service commissioning work, one through the trust and the medical role colleges, and then finally there is a catch all at the end of it which is in a couple of weeks if you have not had contact that way, then you can always raise it with your GP yourself."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (34:09);We’re not keen for people to do that initially. We’re pretty sure we will get most of those people, or they will identify themselves and clearly those GPS are working really hard on the front line at the moment. So there is a catchall at the end of it and the general practitioner is perfectly entitled to raise the issue for any of his patients, his or her patients, that they think are in that category. So hopefully we will catch everyone."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (34:35);I would also just like to say, of course, this is not a treatment that we’re trying to give them. What we’re actually saying is do what we’ve asked you to do, all of the things we’ve said, but just do them very tightly. So in the interim phase, if they just follow the social distancing policy tightly, that’s effectively what we’re asking them to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (34:55);Thanks, Jenny. Larissa Brown, Daily Mail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Larissa Brown: (34:58);Thank you. Prime Minister, people aren’t acting responsibly. So when are you going to get tougher and bring in the police and Mr.-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (35:07);Bring in the police?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Larissa Brown: (35:08);Yes. You’ve talked about curfew, so could you talk about what the police could do and when. Mr. [Jimmerick 00:11:13], People that aren’t on the list, if they’re still worried, can they contact and make use of these community hubs? And Dr. Harris, can you talk a bit about the dangers of being outside and if you can contract the virus whilst you’re walking outside and should over 70s be going on strolls in the evening or should they be staying at home? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (35:33);Thanks. Well, I really repeat the answer I’ve given. I say as firmly, as strongly as I can to everybody that in going outside now, in taking exercise and enjoying themselves, enjoying yourselves out of doors, you’ve got to take account of the medical advice. You’ve got to observe social distancing. And Larissa, yes, you’re absolutely right, and I’ve said it several times now this afternoon, if people can’t…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (36:01);I’ve said it several times now, this afternoon, if people can’t do that, won’t do that, don’t do that, then yes, of course we’re going to have to bring in tougher measures. And we don’t want to do that, of course we don’t, but that may well be necessary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (36:16);Well, if I may answer your question as well, of course, as you heard from Jenny Allie, no system is full safe. There may be some individuals who have not been caught by the various process that we’ve been through, although, because we hope that isn’t the case. If there are people who feel that they fall into that category, they can contact their GP or they can contact their local hub once that’s established. But for all the reasons that Jenny set out, we don’t encourage people to do that today because we don’t want to put an unnecessary burden on GP surgeries and their phone lines."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (36:49);There’s also another group of people who are otherwise vulnerable who will be self isolating or staying at home in the weeks and months ahead, and those individuals may not be on these lists because they may not have a specific clinical reason to be concerned for and for within the shielding initiative that we’re launching today, but nonetheless they may be vulnerable, they may need support, they needed that in many of their medicines and food brought to them. And for them the hubs will absolutely be there to support them, as well all sorts of other volunteering efforts that we’re encouraging as a government and which are already taking off in most parts of the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (37:29);Thanks Robert. Last question from … Oh sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (37:34);So I think you asked the question about 70s and over and going outside. So number one, if the 70 and over are in the shielded group, they should not, we’re saying very, very strongly they’re stay at home, which is very much an enclosed group, which is why it’s such a big thing to ask people to do. If you are 70 and over and are therefore more vulnerable because of your age or perhaps an underlying condition with your age, we are encouraging you to stay at home. We are asking everybody, but this group particularly, to cut right down on their social contacts. The principal running along this and the principle of staying at home is reduce the number of social contacts that you have. So, that applies to this group as well and we’re asking people in the general vulnerable group, the elderly people included in that to do that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (38:21);However, as we’ve heard with a number of these other areas, there is a real balance point here. What we do not want to find is that we grow mental health problems or we grow other physical problems because of such a strict imposition, which is exactly the point that the Prime Minister’s making. So, I think the real point here is we keep discussing but just to put the science behind it, the virus doesn’t last well outside for all sorts of reasons around temperature, UV light, and everything else. So,actually an outdoor environment compared with an indoor one is generally a safer one. But the difficulty is if people are congregating outside or coming together. So, a reasonably fit 70 year old who has been cooped up because he’s safely isolating in a home for a number of times and wants to go for a bit of fresh air and does so at a distance of two meters from somebody else, will no doubt boost his mental health until full able then to tuck himself away perhaps for the next 23 and a half hours quite safely and reduce the total number of his social contacts. So, it is the principles underlying this which are really important and I think it’s those ones that we should be trying to get out to the public and you know through that encouraging people who currently are congregating, they are dangerous. They are making the outside environment unavailable to others who need it. And it’s those individuals that we would ask not to congregate outside and to ensure that everybody can have just a little bit of safe space when they need it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (40:00);Thank you. That’s very, very clear. Charles Haim is 10:00."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Charles Haim: (40:07);One question to you, Prime Minister, is the issue of gatherings and what size is a gathering? The you should restrict and ban and particularly as regarding private gatherings where you might have a group of students who’ve got together for a party, how are you going to deal with that? Are you going to make that illegal?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Charles Haim: (40:25);And then Mr. Jendrick, just very simple, straightforward question on the packages. Is the food going to be free and how will they actually order it? Just the precise details of how that process works."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (40:41);On the technicalities of the size of gathering, if you don’t mind, I’m going to ask Jenny to answer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (40:47);So, I think as we’ve said in a number of these briefings before actually, the very large gatherings, you are still surrounded by a smallish group of individuals and this is that proximity, which is the problem, but it is the social gathering as well, usually with a large one most before and after. So there’s the pub, the restaurant, the getting in the buses in an enclosed environment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (41:09);In actual fact, the epidemiology suggests that it is quite smallish gatherings, which are actually the most difficult. So, somewhere around 10, 12, 15, 20, that sort of size. So, in fact, the reason we’ve probably all not had good Mother’s Days is because having a family gathering where people are quite intimate with each other in terms of the social distancing, it’s very difficult to be in a family group when you know each other very well and stay two meters apart. So, the fact they are probably the riskier gatherings rather than the large ones."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Charles Haim: (41:43);Will you ban them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Jenny: (41:45);Well, we have already asked that people do not go that way. So it was exactly the same message as the outside, which is, it’s very difficult if you are, if you’re living in a family unit, you’re in the same household. But it’s very difficult to actually do that. And throughout all of this, we have tried to put in the science, put in epidemiological methods, but at the end of the day it relies on the public to actually make it work. It’s not something that government or medicine can do. We actually all have to do it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (42:16);And wash your hands."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (42:20);Yes. And on your questions to me, the letters that will go out will provide a whole range of advice, but they’ll also highlight this issue of whether you wish to be part of the shielding arrangement for medicines and for food. You’ll be directed then either to a website which will be applicable for some people, obviously there will be others who won’t want to use that route. There’ll be a phone number that you can call and on either of those routes you’ll be able to state your preferences, whether you don’t have family, friends, neighbors close by, people who could support you, whether you need this service and at that point you’ll be asked what your preferences would be in terms of dietary requirements, medical conditions and so on, which will then guide us to provide the parcel to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Robert Jenrick: (43:05);In the first instance, the product’s going to be free paid for by the Exchequer for simplicity. If over time we’re able to refine it into a more sophisticated offer, which is more tailored to individual’s needs and we’re working with supermarkets to see if that is possible in time, then it may be a different arrangement. But to begin with it’s going to be free to ensure that people who really need it get the supplies as soon as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (43:30);Thanks. I just want to wrap up because we’re going back over this debate that we’ve been having about about public space, open space and how to handle it. Because I think I want get back to the point I was making at the very beginning, which is I want to fight the vast majority of people who are really behaving incredibly responsibly and following the guidance and the advice on social distancing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (43:53);And the difficulty, of course, is that what’s happening is that some people have either through heedlessness or whatever are not making it easy for us because they are, as Jenny says, congregating in a way that is likely to spread the disease. So, we have to think very carefully now about how we take steps to correct that. And as I’ve said, we will be thinking actively over the next few days. But the best thing that everybody can do, if you’re going outside, observe social distancing. Stay two meters apart. It’s not such a difficult thing. Do it. And we say generally to people, “Stay at home.” That is the best way to protect the NHS. That is the best way. If you possibly can stay at home, that’s the best way to save potentially many, many thousands of lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-march-22-warns-italy-style-lockdown-is-possible","Boris Johnson: (44:49);And the more we comply now, with what Jenny and others have been saying, then the faster we will beat it and the faster we will get through it.

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (09:10);Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for today’s daily briefing on coronavirus. I’d like to update you all on the government’s plan to defeat the virus and on the latest developments. I am joined once again by our chief medical officer, professor Chris Whitty and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. From the very beginning of this crisis, I followed the advice of our world leading scientists to defeat coronavirus by taking the right measures at the right time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (09:49);What everybody needs to recognize is that our NHS, like any world class health service, has any limited numbers of doctors, nurses, and specialist equipment. So the more people who become sick at any one time, the harder it is for the NHS to cope. And so it’s vital to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time. That’s why we’ve given the clear instruction that people must stay at home unless they have one of the reasons we’ve set out. With your help, we will slow the spread of the disease. I want to thank everyone who’s been following the clear rules that we set out on Monday. And I want to thank everyone in the NHS, the frontline of the fight against coronavirus, and of course all our public services, our teachers and our school staff, the transport workers, police officers, everyone who’s keeping this country going. But I also want to offer a special thank you-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (11:03);But I also want to offer a special thank you to everyone how has now volunteered to help the NHS. When we launched the appeal last night, we hoped to get 250,000 volunteers over a few days. But I can tell you that in just 24 hours, 405,000 people have responded to the call. They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients. They will be bringing patients home from hospital. Very importantly, they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home. They will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus. That is already, in one day, as many volunteers as the population of Coventry. So to all of you and to all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (12:06);Now I want to take some questions. But, finally, I want to remind everyone of our core policy. Stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives. Thank you. I think we’ll go straight to questions now. We are going to hear, first of all, I think from Laura Kuenssberg of the BBC. Laura are you there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Laura Kuenssberg: (12:35);Thank you, prime minister, yes. Prime minister, can you honestly say that the government is coping? There aren’t enough tests. People are struggling to make ends meet, and some people are being forced to go to work when they don’t feel that they are safe. Is that coping? Can I ask the medics as well, if we already have the kinds of numbers of tests that you would like to see, how much of a difference would it have made to your ability to fight the disease?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (13:03);Well, first of all, Laura, on the tests, a huge national program of testing is being rolled out, but I’ll hand over to Patrick and to Chris to say a little bit more about testing and how we’re going to do it. But on the national effort to protect those whose jobs, whose livelihoods are threatened, I think everybody understands the challenge that the whole country now faces. But we have to get through this together, and we are getting through it together with an unprecedented program of support not just for businesses but for workers of all kinds across the country. Never in our history has the government put its arms around people in the way that we are doing now to help them get through this difficult time. Yes, it is absolutely true that the measures to support people in employment are exceptional and extraordinary. 80% of your salary, up to 2,500 pounds per month, we’re standing behind. We’re also, in the course of the next couple of days, you’ll be hearing more from Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tomorrow about what we’re doing to help the self-employed. I think people do understand that the complexity of their working arrangements has been harder to come up with the right tailored program for the self-employed as well. But that is coming forward tomorrow."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (14:30);Yes, I do think that when you look at the sheer scale of what the government is doing to get this country through, to answer your correction directly, we will cope, and we are coping very well indeed under the most challenging possible circumstances. But the most important thing to enable us to get through it well together and to come out well together, as I think we can, as I know we can, is that we all follow the instructions that the government has given. Stay at home. Protect the NHS. That’s the way to save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (15:09);But on testing, perhaps, Chris, would you like to say some more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (15:15);In terms of testing, there are a variety of different things you use testing for, some of which we have tests available for and have done throughout, some of which we do not. So I’m going to run through them because they’re different answers depending on which you’re talking about. Starting off with the antigen testing, which is testing for people who’ve currently got a disease, we initially were using that to help screen people who came from high-risk countries. When that ceased to be a sensible policy, we moved on to testing people in intensive cares and in hospitals, and we have sufficient tests for that at the moment. The system for that is working fine and is being scaled up. So that side of testing is in place and is working well. So if a patient gets as far as a hospital, we’re confident on the testing and on the scale up."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (16:00);The thing we would like to do next, which would certainly make a difference less to the disease but definitely to the NHS, is being able to test NHS and other critical workers who are self-isolating who currently are not being tested because we do not have sufficient testing. This is a global problem, because basically every country is wanting this new test for a disease that wasn’t actually being tested for anywhere up through three months ago. So everybody wants this. So there is a global shortage, and that’s a bottleneck for us. But the next priority is to get critical workers back to work or to say to them you have got this. So we definitely would like that, not to fight the disease, but to support the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (16:41);Once we have more testing than we need for that capacity, then we want to go out to test a much wider range of people with mild systems. Some people are already having it as part of our surveillance system, but we’d obviously like to go wider. But that’s the prioritization list. Then separately there are other tests which we will want to have, which are not yet absolutely evaluated, but are going to be critical once we’ve got them that can tell someone whether they have had the virus. So this is the antibody test. You can’t do that in the first few days after someone’s had a fever, but after a few weeks, possibly a short as one week. That will allow us to be able to say to NHS workers, to other workers, look, you’ve had this infection at least for the short time and possibly for quite a long time. We think it’s likely you’re protected against this, and you can go back to work and be confident, if you get another cough and fever, that is not going to be Coronavirus. But that’s the sort of technology that’s quite close, and it’s being evaluated this week, but [inaudible 00:17:41] there. On the first one, our bottleneck is largely global shortages, which we are obviously doing our level best to free up, because it would make it a lot better for us to be able to test health care workers now, for sure."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Male: (17:53);Patrick [crosstalk 00:17:54]"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (17:55);… testing is crucial. It’s absolutely crucial, and, yes, we need more of it, as Chris has said. The other thing that’s going to be important with the antibody test is to be able to work out how many people have had the disease asymptomatically. That’s going to be important to understand what to do next. These tests are crucially important. We need more of them. People are working very hard to get them in place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (18:19);The one thing, finally, that I think is the one thing that’s worse than no test is a bad test. So telling someone inaccurately either they have had it or have not had it can lead to dangerous mistakes being made. So we do not want to go ahead with testing until we’re confident of the technology."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (18:36);That is so important. If it means a delay to get there, that delay is worth having, because that is, as Chris said … If you tell someone it’s okay, you haven’t got it, and they have got it, that is not a good position to be in. If you tell somebody they’re immune from it and they’re not, that is not a good position to be in. So we must make sure that we get the quality of this absolutely right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (19:00);[inaudible 00:19:00] Patrick, on the numbers of people who have the disease asymptomatically, there was a study I saw quoted from some Oxford academics saying that as many as 50% may have had it asymptomatically. I think a lot of people have seen that story. How do you evaluate that at this stage?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (19:21);We simply don’t know at the moment. That’s why the antibody test is so important. So there are estimates that up to 80% or more of people in Wuhan weren’t detected. There are estimates that, of those who are positive, so that’s a small percentage of the population who tested positive, quite a number of them were asymptomatic in a town in Italy. But we don’t know at the general population level, and that’s why it’s so important to get this test in place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (19:49);Thank you. Beth Rigby, Sky News."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Beth Rigby: (19:53);Thank you, prime minister, just a couple of questions. You said earlier you’re not closing down the whole of the UK colony. But other countries such as Italy, a country you said we were two or three weeks behind, have now introduced a very strict lockdown. Wouldn’t you save more lives if you did keep all nonessential workers at home? If I may, a question on testing. [inaudible 00:20:23] England has said today 3.5 million testing kits could be available to show whether you’ve had Coronavirus or not as early as next week. In practical terms, who will get those tests and how? In broader terms, how transformational do you think this will be in terms of fighting Coronavirus? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (20:48);Well, thanks very much, Beth. In terms of the epidemiological value of what we’re doing in asking people to stay at home, I think possibly the most thing I could say is just repeat the basic message, which is that if you can stay at home, then you overwhelmingly should stay at home. That’s our most important advice. If it’s absolutely necessary for you to go to work, to a place of work, then it’s vital that your employer follows the rules as set out by Public Health England and ensures that you have the protections that you need, and the proper rules on social distancing do apply. But I wonder whether I could ask [inaudible 00:21:35] comment on the value of what we’re doing in terms of the … Beth asked, reasonably enough, about not closing down the whole UK colony, which we’re not doing. But we’re simply asking people to stay at home. Is there anything you want to say?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (21:49);Well, I can certainly give an answer. Patrick might want to add to this. The first thing is the modeling … Every country does this slightly differently, and every country has got a slightly different epidemic pattern at this point in time, so that’s entirely reasonable."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (22:03);An epidemic pattern at this point in time. So that’s entirely reasonable and all of us of course are dealing with a new infection and therefore are having to take the science from quite a low base very fast in terms of the advice we give."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (22:13);But the modeling we have done here, which Patrick can talk about in more detail, was based on the idea that quite a lot of people would have to go to work as part of this and that is the basis on which the modeling is done. But we absolutely need people to avoid anything that is in any way discretionary, where people can choose whether they do it or not. So that’s why all other social activity, all other mixing between households has to stop, is to allow these absolutely essential things to continue. So that’s the basis of doing this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (22:48);There is an additional reason, which is we have to remember that many of the things we have to do are going to be have to be sustained for a reasonably long period of time and broadly the more difficult you make it for people, the less easy it is to sustain. So there is some degree of trade off between those two things."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (23:07);In terms of testing I want to be really clear about what we can and can’t do. We certainly have acquired, for the UK, a lot of tests, but I would go back to my previous answer, and Patrick’s previous answer, the key thing for us to do is now to evaluate are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public? And if the answer is they’re all incredibly accurate, then we will work out the most quick and effective way to release these."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (23:38);If it turned out none of them were accurate, we would not wish to release any of them because inaccurate testing is something which we really should be avoiding. So the thing we are going to do really fast is the evaluation and then based on that evaluation we will be able to decide what to do next."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (23:54);I don’t know whether perhaps you want to add anything on the modeling side?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (23:57);The only thing I’d reemphasize is what we’re trying to do is to break the transmission of virus from one household to another. We’re trying to break the transmission of virus in society. To do that, we need to keep separate. And the clearest way to keep separate is to stay in your house, and that’s why that’s the core message."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (24:19);There are people who have to go to work in some jobs who cannot stay in their house all day and the most obvious one is in the NHS, but there are others as well. And then it’s important to break the transmission, where possible, to stay two meters apart. And that’s what we need to keep focusing on. We’re trying to stop the transmission of this virus between people, between households, and break that chain."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (24:40);In terms of whether it’s transformational in the long run. The answer is it will completely transform what we can do. In the short run, this antibody test, which is the one that were talking about with these big numbers, I think is less important than the other one, the antigen test I was talking about earlier in a previous answer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (24:59);Thanks. So I should have said more clearly perhaps at the beginning that you should stay at home, except for those very few exceptions. I just spell them out again, if people have forgotten. Unless you need to get essential supplies, Beth, unless your on a specific medical mission or helping the vulnerable, or unless you’re taking daily exercise. And remember the daily exercise is very important, provided you stay away from other people. Gary Gibbon, Channel 4."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Gary Gibbon: (25:33);Prime Minister, the frontline staff and the National Health Service and in working in social care couldn’t be clearer. They want that test on COVID-19 that tells them whether they got it, they want it now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Gary Gibbon: (25:44);In the House of Commons, again and again today, you said they’re going to get it as soon as possible. People might have a little bit more confidence about where we’re going as a country if you could answer this question mainly, how did we come to be so woefully behind other countries that have checked, evaluated, and deployed tests in much, much bigger numbers already?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (26:07);Well, thanks, thanks Gary. I repeat the answer that I gave earlier in the House of commons. We will do it as soon as possible. We are massively ramping up our testing programs, buying in huge numbers of tests to see whether you’ve had it already, but also pushing forward very fast on testing people to see whether they currently have it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (26:31);The antigen or the antibody tests that have been described. And as, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary has said, we’re going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000 and so on. Hopefully very soon up to 250,000 a day."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (26:50);But to answer your question about the types of tests that we have, the differences that you see in between the UK’s provision for testing and other countries, I think it probably would be most helpful if I again pass to Chris and to Patrick to explain. Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (27:08);I think that in terms of the testing, so first of all, why the delays in the UK system? There are multiple components of these tests, including the chemicals that make them up, the swabs that you use, and there are shortages along many of these supply chains, essentially because every country in the world is simultaneously wanting this new thing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (27:28);Some components of it are old, but the scale of this is something which is obviously occurred at extraordinary speed and that’s just a practical reality. And I think anyone who understands how supply chains work and the huge demand for this there is globally would understand that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (27:43);I think comparing different countries is actually quite difficult. Different countries have got different testing strategies, but you’re certainly right that what we need to do is look at those countries that have actually got more testing than us and work out how to do it the way they’re doing it as best we can in our own system using our own testing systems. That’s something we’re doing very actively at the moment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (28:04);Clearly we’re doing a lot of testing here though. For example, looking at the numbers we’ve done so far, 97,000 tests already conducted. It’s not that there is no testing going on, what we need, clearly, is to be able to scale it up."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (28:18);Nothing to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (28:19);I would just add to that that we’ve done many more tests, not that this is a competition, we’ve done many more tests than most other European countries. And you’re totally right, Gary, that the priority should be, and will be, getting those tests to our frontline staff in the NHS. And as I said, we are going to do that as fast as we possibly can. Francis Elliott, of The Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Francis Elliott: (28:50);Yes. Hello, Public Health England this morning suggested that these tests, these antibiotic tests, if they work, could be available from online stores and from Boots. Can we just explain, and I understand that they may not work, but if they do work, how are you going to prioritize who gets those tests or is it just going to be a scramble, and how do you verify the test results? Presumably these will be critically important about whether you can work with vulnerable people or even begin to go back to normal work perhaps. And lastly, how do you collect the results so that you can model what’s happening elsewhere? It seems that you do self testing and this is obviously a very important result."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (29:37);Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (29:38);So what we’ll do is, once we’re confident of which tests work and how many therefore we’ve got available to use, there’s a hierarchy of things that we need to do. We need to start off by answering that critical question that Patrick was talking about. What proportion of people get this without any symptoms? Because that has big implications for the way we then manage this. That’s a very early priority. Then we need to help make sure we can get NHS workers tested to make sure we can work out who is immune, or almost certainly immune, to this infection and who isn’t, and we will basically go out in a graded way from there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (30:16);I do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something we’ll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week. We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from that point of view, and we need to do that in a systematic way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (30:30);And your point, which is right, the first thing we need to do is to collect the information and to understand this epidemic. So it’s not 3.5 million free for all with no data being collected. We need to answer the critical questions and need to make sure the right people get the tests first in order to allow workers to go back, and the other points that Chris has made."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (30:52);Thanks very much, Patrick. Sam Lister, the State Express."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Laura Kuenssberg: (30:58);Thank you. Prime Minister, your critics have suggested that you’ve had to be dragged into taking the action you announced on Monday and that you’ve allowed the virus to spread. Do you regret not going further sooner? And also, if I may, you suggested in the Commons earlier that you might introduce new laws to deal with profiteering. Are you angry at retailers and individuals who are trying to exploit this crisis? And how far are you prepared to go? Could it include jail terms?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (31:30);Thanks very much, Sam. Well, on the first, very important question, as I said right at the beginning, and indeed right at the beginning of this crisis, we were going to do the right measures at the right time, and not according to political dictac, but according to the best scientific and medical advice in the world."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (31:52);There are good reasons for wanting to tackle an epidemic strictly in accordance with the scientific advisor. That is what we have done and I continue to believe that that is the right approach for this country, the right approach for the UK. We have the best scientific advice in the world and we will continue to follow it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (32:10);On your other important question about profiteering, I dislike it very much and I do not want to see people profiteering, people exploiting people’s need, at a critical time, a national emergency. So we are indeed looking very carefully at what is going on. The Competition and Markets Authority already has various powers that it may use, but we are looking at the legislative framework to see what it may be necessary to do to prevent profiteering, just as happened in wartime many, many years ago."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (32:47);Is there anything you want to add on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (32:53);The most important measures got put in place first and that’s the right thing to do. Washing hands was critical. Isolating, household isolation, get these things, and now we’ve got a very…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Patrick: (33:03);… household isolation, get these things and now we’ve got a very strong package in. The one thing I would say, it’s incredibly important that we stick to it. It’s incredibly important that people understand that this is about breaking the transmission of the virus and we can only do that if we all do it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (33:18);That is absolutely right. Thank you. David Hughes, last question. David Hughes, PA."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","David Hughes: (33:25);Prime Minister, by tomorrow it will already be too late for many self-employed people who have already found themselves in hardship or being forced to risk their health and that of others by continuing to work. What’s your message to them, and will you apologize for the delay in providing them with the kind of support that employed workers have already been given? And to the CMO, what’s the current occupation rate of critical care beds in England? Can you be confident that the measures announced over the past week will prevent that capacity being overwhelmed?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (33:53);Well, thanks very much David. I’ll just really repeat what I’ve said before, I think the government has moved with extraordinary speed to support and prop up the whole of the economy of this country, putting our arms around workers of all kinds to the best extent that we possibly can. Yes, of course it was easier to move furthest and fastest with employees because their PAYE details are of course available. It’s been more complex, as you can understand, to support the self-employed because there are many different arrangements that they have and it’s been tricky to work out a package that will address the needs of as many people as possible. But that is being done. It’s being done at incredible speed. [inaudible 00:01:44] we’ll be announcing a package tomorrow."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (34:47);I genuinely don’t think there’s been a time in our history in the last century, certainly, when the government of this country has put its arms around so many people to get us through a very tough time. We will get through it and we will get through it together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (35:05);On critical care, so at this point in time, critical cares, as of today, there is not enormous pressure on critical cares compared to a bad or even normal winter day. For example, in NHS today, but we expect the demand for critical care beds to continue to rise over the next two weeks. That is entirely what we expect to happen and that is what will happen over that time. Clearly the demand is going to go up from the coronavirus. Now because of the actions that people are taking and provided everybody continues to keep the social-distancing measures, which are very difficult in terms of staying within households only doing absolutely essential things apart from exercise, that will help to pull down the demand a very long way. That is how people in the general public, all of us, are helping to protect the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (35:58);At the same time, the NHS is increasing supply by either a combination of pushing out in time things which can be postponed and increasing the critical bed care and particularly the ventilated bed capacity over the next weeks. This is going to be a close-run thing. We all know that. Anybody who looks around the world can see this is going to be difficult for every health system, but the measures that have been announced for the general public, which all of us have to do, if the NHS is to get through this without exceeding its capacity, and the work by the fantastic work by the NHS and my colleagues in the NHS to increase supply, that is the way that we will narrow this gap to the smallest possible gap over the next three weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Chris: (36:48);We do think that if everybody sticks to the staying in your household, and that’s absolutely essential, this gap will be probably managed well by the NHS. But we cannot guarantee that, and nobody who is sensible would wish to guarantee that. But we think that is what we are planning for and that is what we intend to happen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (37:10);Right. Well, thanks, everybody, very much. Thanks to our friends in the media for their questions. Thank you to you all for tuning in and watching this. I hope that it has been useful. We’ll be back tomorrow or there’ll be another update tomorrow here from Downing Street on the fight against coronavirus. But remember the essentials: We will beat this. We will beat it together. We will do it by protecting our NHS, staying at home, and that is how we will save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-daily-briefing-transcript-march-25","Boris Johnson: (37:46);Thanks, everybody."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson gave another press briefing on March 21 for COVID-19 in the UK. He announced the closure of all pubs and restaurants. Full transcript right here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (00:00);Today I am joined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer. Yesterday I set out the ambition of this government to turn the tide against coronavirus within three months. And I want to repeat that determination today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (00:17);We’re going to do it with testing. We’re going to do it with new medicines, and new digital technology that will help us to see the disease as it is transmitted, and thereby, by eliminating it, to stamp it out. And above all, now we’re going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort to slow the spread by reducing unnecessary social contact."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (00:43);And I want to thank everybody for following the guidance we issued on Monday: To stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms, for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms, a new continuous cough or a high temperature. To avoid pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants. To work from home, if at all possible. Keep washing your hands. And I know it’s been tough. And I know it has been inconvenient. But these actions that we’re all taking together are helping to take the strain off our NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (01:20);And bit by bit, day by day, by your actions, your restraint and your sacrifice, we are putting this country in a better and stronger position, where we will be able to save literally thousands of lives, of people of all ages, people who don’t deserve to die now. People whose lives can, must, and will be saved."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (01:48);And as we take these actions together and as we make these sacrifices, we can see the impact on the real economy. Already, fantastic British companies, already under huge strain, big and small. Workers who are finding that their jobs are under threat or going, through new fault of their own. And to all of them, we in government say: We will stand by you. And I say that to companies, remember our joint objective: to beat this virus. And we will do everything in our power to help."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (02:25);And in just a minute, Rishi is going to explain how we’re going to help workers of all kinds to get through this crisis, supporting you directly in a way that government has never done before, in addition to the package that we’ve already set out for business."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (02:46);And of course these measures are intended, these steps that we’re taking are intended, to be temporary. And of course I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back. Of course it is. But I must be absolutely clear with you: The speed of our eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now. And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday, which you will remember."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (03:27);And already, people have made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact. But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (03:41);And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations, we are collectively telling, telling cafés, pubs, bars, and restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow. Though to be clear, they can continue to provide takeout services. We’re also telling nightclubs, theaters, cinemas, gyms and leisure centers to close on the same timescale."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (04:23);Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose, in many cases, of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad thing is, I’m afraid, today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (04:43);And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures. And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. And I say to you, please don’t. You may think that you’re invincible, but there is no guarantee that you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others. So that’s why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home. That’s how we can protect our NHS and save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (05:27);To repeat, I know how difficult this is, and how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people. And I also know how much, right now, workers and business deserve the financial reassurance that we are giving them. But we will get through this. We will get through it together, and we will beat this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (05:55);And to ram that point home: The more effectively we follow the advice that we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (06:11);Thank you all very much. I’m going to pass now to Rishi, who’s going to explain the financial support for workers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (06:19);Thank you, Prime Minister. Good afternoon. The economic intervention that I’m announcing today is unprecedented in the history of the British state. Combined with our previous announcements on public services and business support, our planned economic response will be one of the most comprehensive in the world."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (06:39);Let me speak directly to people’s concerns: I know that people are worried about losing their jobs, about not being able to pay the rent or mortgage. About not having enough set by for food and bills. I know that some people in the last few days have already lost their jobs. To all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: You will not face this alone. But getting through this will require a collective national effort, with a role for everyone to play. People, businesses, government. It’s on all of us to meet our commitment to that effort."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (07:25);I am today announcing a combination of measures unprecedented for a government of this nation. Our plan for people’s jobs and incomes will protect people’s jobs, offer more generous support to those who are without employment, strengthen the safety net for those who work for themselves, and help people stay in their homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (07:49);The first part of our plan is to protect people’s jobs. This week, the government has taken unprecedented steps to fight the coronavirus. We have closed schools. We have told people to stay at home to prevent the spread of infection. We are now closing shops, restaurants, bars. Those steps are necessary to save lives, but we don’t do this lightly. We know these measures will have a significant economic impact. I have a responsibility to make sure that we protect, as far as possible, people’s jobs and incomes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (08:28);Today, I can announce that for the first time in our history, the government is going to step in and help to pay people’s wages. We’re setting up a new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Any employer in the country, small or large, charitable or nonprofit, will be eligible for this scheme."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (08:51);Employers will be able to contact HMRC for a grant to cover most of the wages of people who are not working, but are furloughed and kept on payroll, rather than being laid off. Government grants will cover 80% of the salary of retained workers, up to a total of £2,500 a month. That’s just above the median income. And of course, employers can top up salaries further if they choose to. That means workers in any part of the UK can retain their job, even if their employer can not afford to pay them, and be paid at least 80% of their salary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (09:34);The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to March 1st and will be open initially for at least three months, and I will extend the scheme for longer if necessary. I am placing no limit on the amount of funding available for the scheme. We will pay grants to support as many jobs as necessary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (10:00);And can I put on record my thanks to the Trades Union Congress, the CBI, and other business groups for our constructive conversations? We said we would stand together with the British people, and we meant it. We have never had a scheme in our country like this before. And we’re having to build our systems from scratch."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (10:22);I can assure you that HMRC are working night and day to get the scheme up and running. And we expect the first grants to be paid within weeks, and we’re aiming to get it done before the end of April. But I know that many businesses are hurting now. I’ve already taken extraordinary measures to make cash available to businesses through loans, grants and guarantees."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (10:47);I can announce today that the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme will not be interest free, as previously planned, for six months. It will now be interest free for 12 months. And thanks to the enormous efforts of our critical financial services sector, those loans will now be available starting on Monday. And I will announce further measures next week, on top of those the Governor and I have already taken to ensure that larger and medium sized businesses can also access the credit they need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (11:20);I’m also announcing today further cash flow support through the cash tax system. To help businesses pay people and keep them in work, I’m deferring the next quarter of VAT payments. That means no business will pay any VAT from now until the end of June, and you will have until the end of the financial year to repay those bills. That is a direct injection of over £30 billion of cash to businesses, equivalent to 1.5% of GDP."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (11:57);Let me speak directly to businesses: I know it’s incredibly difficult out there. We in government are doing everything we can to support you. We’re paying people’s wages up to 80% so someone can be furloughed rather than laid off to protect their jobs. We’re deferring over £30 billion of taxes until the end of the financial year. We’re lending unlimited sums of money interest free for 12 months. We’re abolishing business rates altogether this year if you’re in hospitality, retail and leisure. We’re providing cash grants of £25,000 for small business properties. The government is doing its best to stand behind you, and I am asking you to do your best to stand behind our workers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (12:47);We are launching in the coming days a major national advertising campaign to communicate the available business support for businesses and people. Please look very carefully at that support before making any decisions to lay people off. It’s on all of us."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (13:07);We are starting a great national effort to protect jobs. But the truth is, we are already seeing job losses. And there may be more to come. I cannot promise you that no one will face hardship in the weeks ahead. So we will also act to protect you if the worst happens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (13:30);To strengthen the safety net, I’m increasing today the Universal Credit standard allowance for the next 12 months by £1,000 a year. For the next 12 months, I’m increasing the Working Tax Credit basic element by the same amount as well. Together these measures will benefit over 4 million of our most vulnerable households."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (13:56);And I’m strengthening the safety net for self-employed people too, by suspending the minimum income floor for everyone affected by the economic impacts of coronavirus. That means self-employed people can now access, in full, Universal Credit at a rate equivalent to Statutory Sick Pay for employees. Taken together, I’m announcing nearly £7 billion of extra support through the welfare system to strengthen the safety net and protect people’s incomes. And to support the self-employed through the tax system, I’m also announcing today that the next self-assessment payments will be deferred to January 2021."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (14:41);As well as keeping people in work and supporting those who lose their jobs or work for themselves, our Plan for Jobs and Incomes will help keep a roof over your head. We’ve acted already to make sure homeowners can get a three-month mortgage holiday if they need it. I’m announcing today nearly £1 billion of support for renters, by increasing the generosity of housing benefit and Universal Credit, so that the Local Housing Allowance will cover at least 30% of market rents in your area."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (15:16);The actions I’ve taken today represent an unprecedented economic intervention to support the jobs and incomes of the British people. A new, comprehensive job retention scheme. And a significantly strengthened safety net. Unprecedented measures, for unprecedented times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (15:39);Let me close with one final observation: Now, more than at any time in our history, we will be judged by our capacity for compassion. Our ability to come through this won’t just be down to what government or businesses do, but by the individual acts of kindness that we show each other. The small business who does everything they can not to lay off their staff. The student who does a shop for their elderly neighbor. The retired nurse who volunteers to cover some shifts in their local hospital. When this is over, and it will be over, we want to look back on this moment and remember the many small acts of kindness done by us and to us. We want to look back on this time and remember how we thought first of others and acted with decency. We want to look back on this time and remember how, in the face of a generation-defining moment, we undertook a collective national effort, and we stood together. It’s on all of us. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (16:53);Thank you very much, Rishi. Jenny, is there anything you want to say at this stage?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (16:58);[crosstalk 00:16:58] have the chance to answer questions on anything [crosstalk 00:16:58] science."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (16:58);Okay, well, perhaps you can help us field the, any questions from the scientific and medical point of view, as they come. Can I go first to Alex Forsyth from the BBC?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Alex Forsyth: (17:09);Prime Minister, thank you very much. The measures you’ve announced today will have a significant impact, not just on business, of course, but on people’s lives. Can you tell us, what has changed that’s made you introduce these measures now? How long, if you can, do you see these measures lasting, and how do you plan to enforce them? And Chancellor, if I may, you talk about unprecedented measures that you’re taking. How can you be sure that the tax and welfare system can cope to ensure that this support goes to those people who need it, and need it quickly? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (17:39);Thanks. Well, Alex, what we’re doing today is really enforcing what we set out in the fourth part of our advice on Monday. I think people’ve made a huge effort in the last four or five days to comply. We saw big reductions in people attending some pubs, a lot of pubs across the country. A lot of effort was made by people to reduce unnecessary social contact, as we said. But it was becoming clear that in order to drive that curve down, to reduce the unnecessary social gatherings by 75%, which is what the science tells us we need to do to have an impact on that curve, then we need now to be making it absolutely clear that we’re going to enforce these closures. And so that’s the pubs, bars, clubs, and so on that I mentioned, in addition to gyms, leisure centers, and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (18:39);Now, how are we going to enforce it? Well, clearly, there are licensing arrangements that will make it, I think, relatively simple to do, should that really be necessary. And we will enforce it strictly, but in reality, I think everybody can see the imperative of doing what is necessary, of protecting our NHS and saving lives. Rishi?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (19:09);Alex, you’re absolutely right to ask the question. I think when I was here earlier, I said it’s all very well, it’s easy for me to stand here and announce things, but I want to make sure that the help I’m announcing can get to the people that we want to benefit from it. And so that’s why, as we’ve thought about what we’re doing, there are various ways you can design job support schemes, and there are various ways that we can get extra money into our welfare system to strengthen the safety net. We have deliberately focused on scheme design and particular policies that we know are easy to operationalize quickly. And there are many ideas that people have about how to do all these things, and we’ve been looking through all of them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (19:50);But I will put on record my thanks to the staff at HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions. They themselves will be under enormous operating pressure over the coming weeks and months, like all of us, and every business. So as I said, we specifically designed this scheme to work in a way that minimizes the operational complexity. And similarly, with the welfare interventions that we’ve made, we have deliberately picked those that are absolutely the easiest and most straightforward, and require the least manual intervention."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (20:19);Thanks, Rishi. Larisa Brown, Daily Mail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Larisa Brown: (20:21);Thank you, Prime Minister. Could we get to a stage where NHS workers have to choose who to try and save because there aren’t enough ventilators? And also, it’s obviously Mother’s Day this Sunday. Are you urging people to stay away from their mothers? And will you be seeing yours? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (20:42);On the first question, about clinical judgments, doctors in the NHS, clinicians in the NHS, already make very difficult judgements. But our objective, and the objective with this whole campaign, is to ensure that we flatten the curve, as we’ve been saying repeatedly over the last couple of weeks. We flatten the curve, but also that we lift up the line of NHS resilience and capabilities. That means there’s a massive effort going on right now to ensure that we do have enough ventilators, enough ICUs, to cope. And that is why it’s so vital that people follow the measures that we’ve outlined."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (21:23);And as for Mother’s Day: Look, I think my advice would be that people should really think very carefully about, irrespective of whether they are visiting their mothers, any elderly person who may be in a vulnerable group. It doesn’t matter whether they’re necessarily over 70. The issue is whether they are in one of the vulnerable groups. Think very carefully about the risk of transmission of the virus and follow the advice. Look at the medical advice. Our advice is that elderly people, people with serious underlying health conditions, people in the later stages of pregnancy, you have to be careful about the transmission of the virus. And I’m sure people will handle that advice accordingly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (22:22);And I’m in regular contact with all members of my family, but I’ll be working very hard on Sunday, I can tell you that much. I’ll certainly be sending her my very best wishes and hope to get to see her."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (22:37);Shahid Khan, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Shahid Khan: (22:41);Prime Minister, there’s been an escalation in the measures that you have been recommending and advising, and now ordering. Are we going to get to a stage where there are further measures that you’d consider, including potentially limiting transport and movement of people around the country?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Shahid Khan: (22:55);And to the Chancellor, if I may, will this wage protection scheme cover those on zero-hour contracts? If so, given that so many people on zero-hour contracts do not have a set salary every month, how will their wages be determined, and who will determine them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (23:10);Yeah, look, [inaudible 00:23:10], on transport, I don’t know whether you were here yesterday, transport is fundamental to our ability to deliver vital public services. I was pretty clear that we don’t want, for instance, to immobilize the Tube or our major transport networks. It’s just too important for the delivery of crucial public services."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (23:34);Yes, and on those, everyone who’s covered by the scheme, it covers everybody who is on the PAYE system through a company. So we’re publishing detailed guidance shortly. But depending on your particular employment contract, it might be different depending on who you are. It covers zero-hours, covers a variety of different situations. But it may well be that you are on a PAYE scheme and have a set of regular earnings, and it will be covered, depending on your particular circumstance. I can’t generalize for every single person’s employment status, but in general, our desire here is to cover as broad a range of people as possible. We’ve wanted to make it as comprehensive a scheme as possible for those in employment, which is why we haven’t limited it by company, by sector, by size of business. We deliberately targeted it to do as economy-wide an intervention as we can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (24:21);Sam Coates, Sky News."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Sam Coates: (24:23);Sam Coates, Sky News. Chancellor, you’ve announced an extraordinarily large package today. Do you have any sense of how much it’ll cost per month? And presumably it’ll be funded by borrowing, so can you guarantee that this package will be available month after month, up to maybe 18 months, which some of the scientific studies suggest might be the duration of what we’re facing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Sam Coates: (24:49);Jenny Harries, millions of children broke up today for the last time from school. Could you just be crystal clear about what children should and shouldn’t do, from Monday? Can they go to the park, go to the playground, have play dates with their friends? I know there’s a lot of confusion out there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Sam Coates: (25:08);And Prime Minister, Sky News has talked to a senior emergency medicine consultant in a South London hospital today. He’s just warning about the dangers ahead. The fact that they’re not set up for the huge numbers of ventilators needed, the disbelief they feel at the queues outside the supermarket with peoples too close together, and calling for more lockdown, and warning that we could be in a situation worse than Italy, and upset at what they call the falsely-placed sense of optimism they see amongst some politicians. What is your message to that doctor?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (25:41);[inaudible 00:00:25:40]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (25:41);Can I start, Sam? Yep. You’re right. It is a significant intervention. We’ve thought through that and our intention is to finance the package through the government’s normal debt management operations. As we’ve already announced, the treasury and the DMO, the Debt Management Office, are shortly to publish a comprehensive update to the gilt financing remit, and that will be done in April. And of course, the DMO, Treasury, and Bank of England are coordinating closely to support the functioning of the gilt markets, and we’re very confident that we can finance it in that way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (26:13);So I’ve got a very simple answer to that. I think there should be some guidance published today from the Department for Education, which has had clinical and scientific input. The basic strand running through all of these measures is about social distancing and reducing the totality of our social interactions. That applies to children just as it does to the rest of us, but also there is a balance there between maintaining physical and mental wellbeing when we’re going through what will be, for all of us, quite a stressful period. So for children who are at home, a family or a household group usually has the same sort of exposure risk. So put nicely, that just means it’s okay for them to play together usually in their own home environment, kick a ball around in the garden if they have one. We’re not saying don’t go outside, but we are saying if you go outside, go in a way which reduces your social contact."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (27:04);So clearly for children there is a safety issue here, and a safeguarding one. We don’t want to suggest every small child should go off on a solitary walk across the park. That would not be a helpful public health measure. But certainly, with appropriate supervision, buddying children, for example, keeping two meters apart off for a bike ride together or something, that is absolutely fine. And in many ways, we would encourage that. But there are some simple principles, again, around that. Make sure you hang onto your own bike, your own equipment, or whatever. Wash your hands regularly. If you’ve got coughs and sneezes, obviously, use a tissue. All the things that we’ve been encouraging people to do. So very much we want children… The weather is getting better, we want children to be exercising. But to do so not in groups."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (27:50);And I think one of the issues is, where you have team games, for example, it’s not just the team game itself which can be problematic. So I would not encourage those. But the most important bit, also, is the social element around it. So if everybody piles up in shared cars, that’s not a good thing to do. And if everybody tried, they won’t be able to now, but if everybody tried to go to a café or restaurant afterwards, that would also not be a good thing to do. So exercising, fine. But cut right down on the social connections."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (28:21);Yeah, and Sam, just on your last question: I don’t think anybody in government could conceivably be accused of underestimating the scale of the crisis this country now faces. It’s perfectly obvious, when you look at the gradient of the disease, that we have a real threat now to our country, to the ability of our NHS to manage it. And unless we get this right, we are going to see thousands of lives lost, as I say, needlessly. But we have an opportunity, as I’ve said, to get on top of it. To make sure that we turn the tide. And to do that, we’ve got to follow the advice that we’re giving. And that’s why we’re taking the measures that we are today. That’s why it’s absolutely vital that people do avoid unnecessary social contact. And that’s why we’re closing the pubs and the bars and the theaters and so on, because we need now to stop the velocity of circulation of this disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (29:16);And I’ve made it very clear to the country that we will take exceptional measures to do that. But we are also taking exceptional measures to help and to compensate those who are adversely economically affected by what we have to do as a country. And I think everybody understands the two halves of this. Everybody understands that people in employment, businesses, workers, everybody is making a huge sacrifice now to protect the lives of people who are vulnerable to coronavirus. And it’s absolutely vital and right that the government should stand behind those businesses and those workers as well, and that’s what we’re doing today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (29:57);And on your second point about supermarkets, look, I answered this yesterday, and I make the same point again: I think people should shop reasonably and considerately. We do have fantastic supply chains. We’re having another meeting with the supermarkets tomorrow. I am chairing another meeting with the supermarkets tomorrow. And they’re very confident they can get the stuff from farm to fork, so everybody should just shop reasonably and be considerate of others."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (30:29);Francis Elliott, The Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Francis Elliott: (30:34);Thank you. Mr. Sunak, you mentioned shops. Can you clear up whether shops are to be forced to close? It didn’t appear on the list that was mentioned by the Prime Minister."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Francis Elliott: (30:45);And Jenny Harries, could you update us on how we are doing with protective personal equipment? That’s obviously something that’s deeply concerning."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Francis Elliott: (30:55);And Mr. Johnson, could you just say, in very simple terms, what you think about people who are ignoring the advice? I mean, it seems you sort of resisted the temptation yesterday, or the invitation, to say that they were behaving immoral. Do you not think that if people aren’t following these advice, that they are actually being immoral?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (31:16);Rishi, on the shops."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (31:17);Yes. No, just very specifically, the list that the Prime Minister gave and Jenny outlined is a specific list. I was just talking in more general terms. But there’s a very specific category of places where social contact happens, which is significant to the spread of the virus, which Jenny has spoken to and can speak to again. But that, I meant very specifically the places that she had, and the Prime Minister had, referred to already."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (31:39);So yes. So it’s very much those areas where people are gathering for social reasons. So in many ways, they’re almost encouraging the spread of disease, simply by virtue of those establishments. So restaurants, cafés, bars, are where you’re meeting. But we recognize how difficult this is for people’s lives. So having takeout facilities, or the opportunity to convert some of those, means that food supplies will continue. And that applies very much to supermarkets, obviously, and other shops. So it’s leisure centers. If you are exercising outside, that is fine, but inside is not appropriate. So the leisure centers will close. So it’s areas you can imagine where you’re going purposefully for social gathering which are the ones that we’re most keen to reduce the social interactions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (32:26);Yeah, sorry. PPE."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (32:29);Sorry, PPE, yes. So PPE. So the country has a perfectly adequate supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, at the moment. That encompasses quite a wide range of different gowns, masks, gloves, all sorts of things."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Jenny Harries: (32:43);There have been, I think, some differential deliveries, if you like, in some areas, which has caused a degree of concern recently. That is completely resolved now. And in fact, what we’ve done in the last 36 hours is set up an entirely separate PPE oversight and supply chain, which allows hospitals… but also we need to be very clear there are other workers in the care system who are equally important… and will allow that appropriate management to ensure that the supply and demand is there. And I think we do need to be really clear, this is an unprecedented health event for this country. And so it is not unlikely, in many ways, that we will have found a pressure in the early days where an individual hospital, individual trust, or an organization has had to suddenly ramp up its demand. But that supply is there. And running alongside that is a call out to arms, a bit like ventilators and testing as well, to make sure we are exploring every avenue and opportunity for keeping those supplies coming through."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (33:47);Yeah. Francis, on your moral point: I don’t want to get into moral name-calling and so on and so forth. But I do accept that what we’re doing is extraordinary. We’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub. And I can understand how people feel about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (34:09);But I say to people who do go against the advice that we’re getting, the very clear advice that we’re getting from our medical and scientific experts: You’re not only putting your own life, the lives of your family, at risk, you’re endangering the community. And you’re making it more difficult for us to get on and protect the NHS and save lives. And if you comply, if people comply as I say, then we will not only save lives, thousands of lives, but we’ll come out of this thing all the faster."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (34:40);Tom Newton Dunn, The Sun."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Tom Newton Dunn: (34:44);Thank you, Prime Minister. By closing pubs, restaurants, clubs, et cetera, is it not a considerable risk that what you’ll therefore do immediately is push, maybe, many young people into their own homes? They’ll just have big parties. You’re not going to ban parties, or are you? And what is your advice to young people? Not to gather in groups of a hundred and drink the same amount behind closed doors?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Tom Newton Dunn: (35:07);And Chancellor, if you don’t mind me asking, the one element of society affairs you missed out with all this is charities, the voluntary sector. Though you’re covering their wages, charity income is down 40% since they started this in only a couple of weeks. They’ve asked you for a bailout as well. Will you now consider that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (35:25);You can start. Tom."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (35:28);Thank you. So in terms of support for the charity sector, the significant business rates relief schemes that we operated in the last or two will certainly benefit them, which will have direct cash flow benefit to them, and they are covered by today’s intervention, which I would underscore is significant. In terms of more support for voluntary and community groups, that’s something that I’m actively talking to the Secretary of State for Communities for, and especially as we try and look after the most vulnerable in our communities, it may well be that we should increase funding for local voluntary community groups to help with that. And that’s something I’d say we’re actively looking at."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Rishi Sunak: (36:08);But just to underline more broadly, the scheme that I’ve outlined today is unprecedented in scope and scale for a British government. And it is an enormous commitment by us to British jobs and British workers. This is going to be difficult, but we are with you through this. And we are doing absolutely everything we can to support your jobs and to support your incomes through this time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (36:32);Yeah, and Tom, on your point about young people: Obviously we can’t forbid every form of socializing between human beings. Of course we’re not doing that. But on the other hand, what we are saying is that the risk is not just for young people. The risk is that they will become vectors of the disease for older relatives, with potentially fatal consequences. And we ask people to think about that. And that’s why we’re taking the decisive steps we’re taking in respect of places that actually invite people to socialize. That’s why we’ve issued the very strong advice that we have. And I really hope everybody takes it. I’m afraid we’re going to have to wrap up now, because we’ve got more things to go and weigh and do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (37:23);But two important things that I hope you’ll take away from today, two important bits of news: Yes, we are telling pubs, bars, restaurants, clubs to close. Gyms, leisure centers, we’re telling them to close. And it’s a huge wrench to do that. Everybody understands that. It’s a huge wrench. And it’s heartbreaking to think of the businesses that will face difficulties as a result of the measures this country has had to take."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (37:53);But that is why we are also simultaneously announcing a quite exceptional package of support, and not just for businesses, but for individual workers. And our message to business is that we will stand behind you, and we hope that you will stand behind your workers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-update-transcript-uk-shuts-down-pubs-restaurants","Boris Johnson: (38:15);And to the country: This time, it is different. We all remember what happened in 2008. This time, we want to make sure, as we heal the economic damage that this is causing, that we put the people first. Thanks all very much."

They gave updates on the coronavirus threat to the United Kingdom and efforts to combat the virus. Full transcript here."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (00:00);… All the emergency services, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service, with local authorities and the NHS to lead communities through this challenging period. From Cornwall to Cumbria, we’ve embedded within each of these groups members of the armed forces, including some of the finest military planners in the world. These groups are planning the local response to the virus using their expertise, their judgment and their leadership to ensure a comprehensive, a coordinated, and a consistent response across the country. Now, one issue that they have been helping us to coordinate and about which I know there is a lot of concern is the provision of personal protection equipment. We simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the front line without the right protective equipment. We have a clear plan to ensure that those serving this country at this time have the right equipment. We’ve established a national supply distribution response team, and they’re supported now by members of the armed forces and other emergency services who are working around the clock to deliver the equipment to the people who need it most."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (01:33);170 million masks, 42.8 million gloves, 13.7 million aprons, 182,000 gowns, almost 10 million items of cleaning equipment, and 2.3 million pairs of eye protectors, all delivered to 58,000 NHS trusts and healthcare settings, including GP surgeries, pharmacists and community providers. Every single GP practice, dental practice and community pharmacy has had a PPE delivery. All care homes, hospices and home care providers have or will shortly receive a delivery. To NHS and social care workers, all those who rely on this equipment and to their families and loved ones watching this afternoon, we understand. And we will not stop until we have got you the equipment that you need. Now, last weekend at this press conference, the prime minister and I explained why 1.5 million people who are extremely vulnerable to the virus due to the underlying health conditions needed to stay at home for a period of 12 weeks, and avoid face to face contact."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (03:12);Since then, the NHS have written to almost a million of these people and outlined the steps that they need to take to protect themselves. We’ve also established a dedicated webpage on gov.uk which those in receipt of the letter should go to to let us know whether or not they need further assistance over the course of the next 12 weeks. There’s also a new phone number which is on the letter they have or will receive shortly. Now, if this applies to you, I know that you will find this a very worrying time. You’ll be thinking about how you can continue to access the medicine that you need, how you can get the food and other essential supplies that you rely on. If you don’t have family or friends or neighbors nearby who you can rely on, then the NHS will deliver your medicines through the community pharmacy network."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (04:14);If you register online or using the phone service that we’ve set up letting us know that you need support, then we will deliver food and supplies to your doorstep. And this weekend I saw for myself firsthand the first deliveries being made. The packages included, cereal, fruit, tinned goods, teabags, biscuits, toiletries and other essentials. The first 50,000 will have been sent out by the end of this week, and we’re ramping up production to send out as many as are required for as long as it takes. If this applies to you, while you will now have to be at home for a prolonged period of time and that will be difficult, I want you to know that you are not alone. We’re here to support you for as long as you need us. We’ve all been hugely impressed by the commitment and the dedication of those working in social care in local councils delivering essential public services, like ensuring that the bins continue to get collected."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (05:34);None more so than me as the secretary of state for local government. We all respect the 12,000 heroic former doctors and nurses and paramedics who have come back to work and being deployed this weekend. And I think we’ve all been moved by the number of people who’ve signed up to be one of the NHS voluntary responders. Today we can announce an extraordinary three quarters of a million people have signed up to do that. In every city, in every town, in every village there’s going to be work to be done, and in each of us there is the power to do it, and so please take part, please play your part, please consider your friends, your family, your neighbors when you’re shopping. Please call the elderly and support them. When this is done, and it will be done. We all want to be proud of the part that we’ve played together. Thank you very much. And now I will answer some questions from the media, and I think the first question today is from Simon Israel from Channel Four news. Good afternoon Simon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Simon Israel: (06:58);Good afternoon minister. I have two questions. One for you and one for Dr. Paris. My question to you is 10 days ago the prime minister predicted the tide would be turned in 12 weeks. What’s the current forecast? And to Dr. Paris, I want to ask a message sent to staff today at King’s Hospital Trust said, and I quote, “The number of deaths being reported at Kings in national figures is below what they are experiencing.” This is not just Kings, there are a number of other trusts and the center has been made aware. Are … At what point are we being given accurate up to date figures on the numbers who have died?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (07:43);Well, thank you Simon. If I can begin before handing over to Jenny, nobody’s pretending that this will be over in a few weeks. But what the prime minister said in the past, and I will reiterate today, is that if we all play our part, if we all follow the very clear medical advice, then we can turn the tide of this virus. And at the heart of that is a very simple message, which is to stay at home. By doing so, protect the NHS and then save lives. If we follow that advice, then we can turn the tide, and the more we adhere to that advice, the more lives will be saved and the faster we’ll begin to do that. Jenny?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (08:29);Thank you. So just picking up the point about the tide and the turning, I think this is an important message to get across to the public. As I said previously on a number of these interviews, this is a bit of a moving feast which is dependent on the actions that we take as individuals and collectively as a population. If we practice social distancing effectively, we will move the peak across, and that is a good thing because as we move it, it will drop. So we need to keep practicing. The data that we have the modeling going forward will suggest that in the time period which the … Sorry, the prime minister noted, which was 12 weeks, we would get on top of the virus, and that is exactly what I hope we will do. The proof of that will come in around two to three weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (09:22);That is because our most constant figures, and we’ll come back to this in a moment, are the deaths, and the deaths follow the numbers of infections. And where it’s usually a two or three week time lag, and we also need a lag for the effectiveness of the intervention measures to come through. So what I keep saying frequently, and I’m sorry if I’m repetitive, is that we need to wait for two to three weeks to see what we have achieved collectively. And then the slope of that curve will start to indicate where a new peak will be. But we’re optimistic that that peak will be lower. So we need to keep looking at this, but it will be two to three weeks before we are-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (10:03);We need to keep looking at this, but it will be two to three weeks before we are clear whether the peak has shifted across or not. I think that was the first question. The second one that you raised was around deaths. Clearly every death that we have is a really sad event. It involves the family and a lot of sadness. We have to make sure that when we’re reporting, the family is content and knows, and that all our data is absolutely accurate. For any event like this, whether it be COVID, whether it was Ebola, whatever it is, there is always a time lag for us to check and evaluate that the data across the system is linked. We do not want to be misreporting data and then having to correct it. The public would not have confidence if we were doing that, and as we have had sadly to register more deaths, that time period takes longer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (10:55);I’m not aware of the communication from [inaudible 00:00:58]. It may be that that’s gone back into the NHS. What I can say is all of our data links up and there is a time lag, and for the reporting yesterday, it would have been the deaths reported the previous day. So it is inevitable that there will be a time lag. This is not an issue of transparency. It’s an issue of ensuring that all of those family that need to know and all the parts of the system can consolidate the information and ensure it’s accurate for the public."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (11:28);Thank you, Jenny. I think that’s very clear. I’ll take the next question from [Pool 00:11:31] brand from ITV. Pool."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Speaker 2: (11:31);Yeah. Thank you. Firstly to the deputy chief medical officer. Originally we were told that the lockdown measures would be for three weeks. Is it safe to now assume that they will go on for much longer than that? To the secretary of state, when will the government be making that reassessment so that people can plan their lives?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (11:52);Shall I start with that one? I think if you look back what the prime minister said was he would review in three weeks and that actually links back to the point that I’ve just made. It would be foolish of us to start something one day and assume that it was going to have an impact the next. For all of us, it’s taken quite some time to get used to this new way of living to ensure that we practice social distancing and we stick to that. As a population we have evidence that we are getting better at that as we go through. People are staying at home more as they should, they’re using transport less. They’re only going to work when it’s essential. So those measures have now been in place solidly for a week or two. We need another couple of weeks to see that through, and as I’ve just mentioned earlier, the issue of the three weeks is for us to review where we are and see if we’ve had an impact jointly on the slope of that curve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (12:44);I think to make it clear to the public, if we are successful, we will have squashed the top of that curve, which is brilliant, but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living. That would be quite dangerous. If we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak. Over time, probably over the next six months we will have a three week review. We will see where we’re going. We need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal. I think three weeks for review, two or three months to see whether we’ve really squashed it, but about three to six months ideally and lots of uncertainty in that. But then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal, and it is plausible that it could go further than that. We just need to wait to see how successful we’ve been. Of course the bottom line is as we always say, keep practicing good social distancing. Because we will manage it quicker and better between us."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (13:50);Well absolutely. From the outset of this crisis we drew up the measures that could be implemented, and then on expert medical advice, we have chosen the right time for this country to implement them. We’ve taken a number of very significant steps on social distancing over the course of the last 10 days, as Jenny has just said. It is the nature of this virus that it takes a couple of weeks to see how effective each one of those in turn has been. When we’ve implemented them, we’ve said that we will review these in three weeks or so and when the prime minister made his announcement on Monday bringing to a close nonessential shops and encouraging us all to stay at home to restrict what we do in our leisure time, he made clear that we would review these steps at Easter on the basis of the expert medical opinion and that’s exactly what we intend to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (14:48);The evidence that I have seen suggests, as Jenny has said, that the public generally complying. I’ve spoken to a number of chief constables from across the country over the course of the last few days and business owners are behaving very responsibly. Of course, there are always small numbers of people who aren’t, but in general the public is doing the right thing. The more we comply, the more we will be able to protect the NHS to save people’s lives, and the faster we’ll turn the tide on the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (15:20);If I could take the next question from David Shukman, who’s from the BBC. David, good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","David Shukman: (15:28);Thank you very much indeed. The two questions, if I May, first Mr. Jenrick to you, the prime minister in his letter talks about leveling with the public about things getting worse before they get better. What do you think the coming week is going to look like, and then a question for Dr. Harris. We’ve had confirmation of the very sad death of an ENT surgeon, Amged El-Hawrani. What do you think that says? What message does that send to NHS staff on the front line?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (15:58);Well. Thank you very much David. Can I also give my deepest sympathies to the family of Dr. El-Hawrani? We heard the news just a few moments ago that he had very sadly passed away. With respect to your question, the prime minister has now written, or will be over the course of this week, to all the households in this country setting out very clearly the task that is before all of us. We see on the news the difficult scenes in other European countries, like Italy for example. The deaths that we are reporting daily and these press conferences are very sobering. Every death is a tragedy. We don’t want to see any unnecessary death."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (16:42);So what the prime minister has said to all of us in that letter is that we all have the power to influence the course of events with respect to this virus. If we want to protect people’s lives, if we want to help the NHS to be able to have the capacity to continue to perform the good quality public service that we all want it to do throughout the course of the virus, then we need to take heed of the medical advice. We do need to stay at home. By doing that, we’ll protect the NHS and we’ll help to save people’s lives. This is on all of us. We all have a responsibility to protect each other. We just need to follow the advice in the days and weeks ahead. Jenny."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (17:29);Okay. Well, clearly you will not expect me as a medical professional to comment on an individual case. That would be normal practice, but equally as a medical professional, of course, I’m very saddened by the fact that one of our professional colleagues has passed away. It clearly is a worrying event. It’s worrying for the nation because it’s another death in our statistics. It’s another loss to a family, and it will be a loss to an NHS family as well. I think for NHS staff on the front line, and our caring staff, it’s not just in our health services, it’s all people who are battling against this virus, they will inevitably be concerned. Some of the work that we’re doing around communications and around personal protective equipment is to just try and ensure there is a common understanding between us of the support that is there for them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (18:25);It is in no one’s interests that we lose our colleagues on the front line and we really, really want to support them. The only thing I would say is though, clearly in a disease like this, which is affecting everybody, we just need to remember that it’s not just the NHS or just a family. We’re finding this right across the population. It will affect all of us. It will upset undoubtedly our colleagues in the NHS, excuse me, but we shouldn’t take that as any signal specific to their NHS. We do have some new guidance coming out for colleagues in the NHS shortly, and I’m hoping that will help to support them in their work on the front line."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (19:09);Thank you, Jenny, and the guidance that’s going to be published shortly will also apply to those working in other essential public services, for example, in social care, in local government and other settings, so that they can have the best possible advice as to the type of PPE that they need to continue to do their role safely in the days ahead. The next question I think is from Sam Lister from The Express. Sam."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Sam: (19:35);Oh, thank you. If I could ask Dr. Harris first, I just want to be really clear about what you’ve said. Are you saying that come judgment day in two or three weeks time, if you’ve not seen the necessary changes that you require, the country realistically is facing lockdown for six months."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Sam: (19:54);If I could ask the secretary of state, we’ve seen a number of police forces over the weekend set up hotlines where people can report concerns about-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Speaker 3: (20:02);… where people can report concerns about the neighbors or the people they believe how flouted the rules. Would you encourage people to raise their concerns with these hotlines?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (20:13);So I’ll start with that one. So I think just to be clear on what I have actually said, I don’t think I have said we will be in lockdown for six months, just to be clear. I also haven’t said we’ll definitely be in the best place possible until three weeks. The important thing is this is a moving target. If we do well, it moves forward and comes down and we manage all our care through our care, health and care systems sensibly in a controlled way. And that’s what we’re aiming for. The issue about the two to three weeks is there is a time lag between when somebody gets the disease and becomes symptomatic and potentially transmits it. And then very sadly for those people who become ill, they will be, usually are real for a period of time and then deteriorate in their health status."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (21:04);And sadly, some of them will end up dying, and there are time periods for that. So one for how well we do our intervention, if we’ll stop shopping on Monday, we would not expect any of this data to change on Tuesday. We would expect to start seeing a footfall dropping over the first week, we would start to see new infections dropping over the next week and we would start to see deaths dropping over the following week. So the implication there is, and the prime minister’s letter is we actually anticipate that our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, and then we are looking to see whether we have managed to push that curve down and we start to see a decline."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (21:46);The issue about the timeframe is really important. So this is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months, but it means that as a nation, we have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what we’re all doing until we’re sure that we can gradually start lifting various interventions which are likely to be spaced based on the science and our data until we gradually come back to a normal way of living and that may mean that we have a few bumps on the way rather than the nice curves that you’ve seen in graphs in the media or on our charts."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (22:23);It’s really important that we all do that together. We will not have succeeded until we get right to the end of this outbreak and we understand how the disease transmits. As we get more information in due course about the pattern of transmission, then we will have more insight into how to manage that tail end of it and we can provide more information then."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (22:46);Thanks Jenny. Well, as I said earlier, the measures that we’ve taken, which are very restrictive and not things that we’ve taken lightly, the evidence that we’ve seen so far suggests a high degree of compliance from members of the public. The scenes that we saw last weekend have by and large not being replicated this weekend. Police forces have reported very few instances of nonessential retailers remaining open against the rules. And so I think it’s very encouraging that people are increasingly taking this seriously and playing their part in helping us to protect the NHS and save lives as a result. Police forces have powers. They are able to enforce these measures. They can fine individuals and those fines can ratchet up for the very small number of people in society who repeatedly refuse to follow the measures and take the advice of the police. And that’s absolutely right. But we want to do this by consent. We want to do this with us all coming together in a national effort. And there’s a moral obligation on all of us to play our part, protect ourselves, but also protect others."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (24:02);And that’s regardless of your age. And there are many young people who feel that they are invincible. That isn’t correct. The virus affects all of us, but each of us has the ability to protect others. And so I really urge, once again, everybody to pay heed to adhere to the strong medical advice that we’ve all received to stay at home and where you do go out, do it in the manner that we’ve advised, respecting social distancing advice. And when you can’t work from home, try to work from home, but when you can’t do so, then go to work and at work, follow Public Health England’s guidance whilst you’re there as well so that together we can protect the country and begin to turn the tide."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (24:52);Now, I’ll come down to the last question, which is from Jack Blanchard from POLITICO. Jack, good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jack Blanchard: (25:00);Thanks very much. A question for each of you please. First, Chief Medical Officer, we’ve seen very alarmingly large increases in the number of deaths over the last each of the last two or three days. Is that as you had expected or are the number of deaths increasing more quickly than you had hoped? And secretary of state, have you modeled more extreme social distancing measures? Should they be necessary? And can you give us an indication of where things might go if what we’re doing so far doesn’t prove to be enough."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (25:33);So thank you for that Jack. Sadly, the answer is yes, it is as expected in many ways. It’s not an easy position to stand on a platform and say we expect a large number of people to die, but we have a pandemic on our hands and it is an unprecedented event for this generation in this country. I think it is because of where we are on the [inaudible 00:25:56] all the above, as I’ve said previously, applies. We are expecting that that number will increase for the next week or two, but then we anticipate that if we keep doing what we’re doing, and I can’t emphasize that we have to keep doing it, it’s no good just doing it for a few days and stopping, that we do anticipate that those numbers will start to drop."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (26:17);The important thing about the number of deaths and it is a very sadly, an easy to count statistic if you like, and it’s quite difficult to translate what it means often to the public in terms of death rates. And there has been a huge amount of media written and reported on that, but it is a stable statistic, but it lags behind impressions on the rate of increase of infections. So we just need to watch it carefully, hold tight for a week or two, keep doing what we’re doing and then come back and ask me the question again and I think hopefully we’ll be on the way down a little bit."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (27:00);That’s right. Well, I think as Jenny said, the task for us all now as a country is to adhere to the social distancing measures that we’ve already announced. These are very significant moves, unprecedented in our peace time history. If we all follow those measures, then there’s every reason to believe that we can turn the tide on the virus and we’ll be able to protect the NHS and to save people’s lives. Of course, if those measures prove insufficient or if members of the public are not complying with them, then we will have to consider what further options are available to us. But that is not our intention. We hope and believe that these measures can be sufficient. But it will take, because of the nature of the virus, a couple of weeks as Jenny’s articulated, before we can see whether that’s truly happening."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Jenny Paris: (27:50);And if I could just add to that just for reassurance because obviously we’ve talked a lot about the capacity of the NHS to manage the number of people flowing through. We have plenty of capacity in the NHS right now to manage people coming through the system. So those deaths represent, very sadly, individuals who have not been able to respond to the high quality care that the NHS has provided."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (28:14);Very good. Well, I think there’s… Sorry, I think there’s one further question please from Channel 5."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Kate Proctor: (28:25);I think the further question is from Kate Proctor from The Guardian."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (28:30);Oh, sorry. I do apologize, Kate. Go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Kate Proctor: (28:31);It’s okay."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (28:32);Hi, good evening?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Kate Proctor: (28:35);Afternoon. Seeing the reports of Britt stranded abroad, he really, really wants to get back to the UK. And what can you tell us about the size and the scale of the repatriation package that you’re going to put together? Germany has put aside €50 million. Will Britain be putting together something on a similar scale and will you be using the RAF to bring people home? And if I may, Michael Gove this morning said that the UK haven’t got all the information that it needed from China to make some decisions earlier on in the coronavirus outbreak. Do you know what information was missing from decision making?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (29:09);Well, thank you Kate. Well, firstly, with respect to British citizens overseas, we have and take seriously our responsibility to protect our nationals wherever they are in the world. That’s a top priority for the government. And the foreign secretary has been working extremely hard with British missions all over the world to try to bring those citizens back to the UK. And he spent this weekend speaking with his counterparts in a range of countries where there are citizens who we want to get back safely to the UK as soon as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (29:40);We’ve advised British citizens abroad to come back to the UK whilst there are still commercial flights available. That isn’t the case in all countries, but it is in many. We haven’t ruled out repatriation flights and we are doing those in some cases. There is a flight ongoing at the moment, for example, to Peru to bring back a group of British citizens who’ve been in a difficult situation there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (30:03);If we need to do more steps of that kind in the days ahead, then we will of course do so. We want to get those British citizens back safely to the U.K. With respect to the international picture more generally, well the U.K. is leading the international efforts. This is a global pandemic and we want to play our part to the full. the prime minister has been speaking to his counterparts from the G7 and the G20 we are now the world’s leading country in offering funding to support vaccine research. Almost $500 million pounds we’ve offered and we will put more at the disposal of that very important mission if that’s required. And there may be more steps that we can do as an international community in the future and we want to be absolutely at the heart of that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-british-officials-give-coronavirus-updates-on-march-29","Robert Jenrick: (30:56);Of course there will be lessons to be learned in the future about how we and other countries have responded to this virus. But the U.K., our government at the moment, is focused 100% on trying to save lives here. And that means putting in place the measures that we’ve discussed today. It means supporting the NHS and social care, shielding those vulnerable individuals for whom we’ve been providing food parcels beginning this weekend. And above all, for people listening this evening to this broadcast, it means each and every one of us in our own lives following the advice from Jenny and her colleagues. Stay at home, protect the NHS. And that is the way that we can all save lives and begin to turn the tide on the virus. So thank you, Jenny, for joining us this evening. And thank you very much indeed everybody for watching at home."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab and other British officials held a briefing for the U.K. on COVID-19 today. Raab talked about Boris Johnson’s absence and how the government is delegating work while the prime minister is in critical condition, and he is confident that Johnson will recover from coronavirus. Read the full transcript here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (00:00);A lot of people would be concerned about that. I can tell you he’s receiving the very best care from the excellent medical team at St. Thomas’s hospital. He remained stable overnight. He’s receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance. He’s not required any mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support. He remains in good spirits and in keeping with usual clinical practice, his progress continues to be monitored closely in critical care and we’ll give further updates on the PM’s condition when there are any material developments. I know that there’s been a groundswell of messages of support from people here at home, from leaders across the world and I know that everyone will want to join with me in wishing the prime minister a very swift recovery. As you all know, the prime minister asked me to deputize for him whilst he recovers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (00:54);In line with the prime minister’s instructions, this morning I chaired the meeting of senior ministers tackling coronavirus and this afternoon I chaired an update for members of the Cabinet. I think it’s probably worth just remembering that as will be the case for many people up and down the country who knows someone at work who’s fallen ill with a coronavirus, it comes as a shock to all of us. He’s not just the prime minister for all of us in Cabinet, he’s not just our boss. He’s also our colleague and he’s also our friend. So all of our thoughts and prayers are with the prime minister at this time, with Carrie and with his whole family. I’m confident he’ll pull through because if there’s one thing I know about this prime minister, he’s a fighter and he’ll be back at the helm leading us through this crisis in short order."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (01:49);Of course, for us in Cabinet, we know exactly what he wants from us and what he expects from us right now. Following the Cabinet discussion today, I can reassure the prime minister and we can reassure the public that his team will not blink and we will not flinch from the task at hand at this crucial moment. We will keep all of our focus and all of our resolve with calm determination on delivering the government’s plan to defeat the coronavirus. It’s with that objective and with that unity of purpose that the Cabinet turned to business today. We had reports from four ministerial groups on the action we’re taking across all of the strategic priority areas, including NHS capacity, procurement of ventilators, and personal protective equipment, the delivery of public services including social care, on the economy, and our support for both businesses and workers, and of course on the international action we’re taking to reinforce our efforts on the home front."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (02:49);As we’ve explained before, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time and that will help us protect the NHS’s ability to cope. At every step, we’ve been following the scientific advice, the medical advice, and we’ve been very deliberate in the actions that we’ve taken so that we take the right steps at the right moment in time. We’re increasing our NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff, lifesaving equipment on the frontline so people have the care they need when they need it most. As we’ve consistently said, we’re instructing people to stay at home so we can protect the NHS and so that we can save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (03:37);So today, I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program that again, as of today, 213,181 people have now been tested for the coronavirus, 55,242 people have tested positive. The number of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms now stands at 18,589. Of those who have contracted the virus, 6,159 have, I’m very sorry to say, died. Every death in this pandemic is a tragedy and our thoughts and our prayers are with their loved ones at what must be an incredibly difficult time. I think these figures reinforce that the single most important thing that we can all of us do right now in this national effort to defeat the coronavirus is keep on following the government’s advice, which is to stay home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now turn to Sir Patrick who I think will talk us through some of the data."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (04:39);Thank you very much. May I have the first slide, please. It’s worth remembering this is a brand new illness. It transmits relatively easily and in some people of course, it’s severe. It’s therefore important that we break the transmission in society we do not allow this virus to go from household to household and that’s what the social distancing measures are about, trying to slow the rate of transmission. In order to know whether those measures are working, we track a number of things and here you can see the transport use change which we’ve shown before indicating very substantial reductions in the use of London Underground, the buses, national rail and indeed, use of all motor vehicles. This and other measures show that the contact between people has reduced dramatically as a result of the social distancing measures that have been put in place. That, in turn, should lead to a substantial reduction in the transmission of the virus in the community."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (05:44);This, if I can have the next slide, please, moves then through into the fewer new cases appearing is the aim to try and reduce the number of new cases. This shows the number of cases since the 16th of March through to the 7th of April and what you can see is there is not that big upswing of growth that we talked about at the beginning. There is a fairly steady increase in numbers. It’s possible that we’re beginning to see the beginning of change in terms of the curve flattening a little bit. We won’t know that for sure for a week or so, but what we’re not seeing is an acceleration. It’s important that we keep these new cases down because of course, this in turn, leads to the number of people going into hospital. The aim all along is to reduce the number of cases below the capacity for the NHS and to save lives. Can I have the next slide, please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (06:43);This graph shows the number of hospital admissions in London at the top and then in other areas you can see, again, there’s been a steady increase since the 16th of March up until the 7th of April, but there hasn’t been the accelerated takeoff. Again, it’s possible that we’re beginning to see the start of a change where we might see numbers flattening off. We won’t be sure about that for a week or so and we need to keep looking at it, but it does begin to suggest that things might be moving in the right direction in terms of numbers. It’s important that we carry on with the measures we’ve got in place in order to make sure that this does go in the right direction. The important thing beyond these numbers is what happens in intensive care units and that we keep the intensive care unit number down as well. That’s another thing which may be moving in the right direction, but I do want to, here, say a big thank you to everybody in the NHS, the frontline staff who are working so hard to make this work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (07:49);One other point, as well as looking at numbers, there are clinical trials starting trying to look at treatments that might make a difference. As of this afternoon there are over 1,900 patients in clinical trials across a hundred hospitals. That’s an important part of how we’re going to tackle this. The ICU beds are important, and the next slide, please, shows that the number of ICU beds has been increasing. So this is a graph over time from the 21st of March, the 6th of April showing an increase in the ICU beds that’s been most marked in London, which has had the biggest outbreak so far, but it’ll increase in the rest of the country and the new Nightingale hospitals in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Harrogate, and further increases in capacity of what the NHS is planning for to cope with the numbers that we’re talking about."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (08:44);Finally, I’ve talked about the beginning, I talked about the fact that we need to see that coming through into admissions to hospitals and to ICU, and then it takes a few weeks for that to feed through, unfortunately, for some people into death and I’d like to just show the death figures. So these are the graphs showing the numbers of deaths across different countries. You can see that despite a little uptick in the numbers today and the numbers do bounce around the UK is on track. We’re roughly a couple of weeks behind France, a few weeks behind Italy in terms of the numbers, but you can see that broadly, things across Europe move in the same direction. We would expect the numbers of deaths to lag after the ICU cases by a couple of weeks. So we should expect these to start coming down in two or three weeks time. Thank you for foreign secretary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (09:34);Thank you, Patrick. I’m now happy to take some questions from the media. Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Laura Kuenssberg: (09:41);Thank you very much for foreign secretary. With the prime minister, absent at this vital time, if there is a genuine disagreement in the Cabinet, who actually makes the decision? If I can ask the chief scientific advisor, you’ve shown that there has been an increase in the capacity of the number of intensive care beds available around the country, but on the current numbers, will there be enough beds as this grows?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (10:05);Well, first of all, decision-making by government is made by collective Cabinet responsibility. So that is the same as before, but we’ve got very clear directions, very clear instructions from the prime minister. We’re focused with total unity and total resolve on implementing them so that when he’s back, and I hope in very short order, we will have made the progress that you would expect and that the country would expect."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (10:30);In terms of the ICU beds, and Chris Whitty has being clear about this as well, there are always times in every winter when ICU beds top out in individual hospitals and that may happen and I can’t guarantee it won’t. What we can say, though, is that the numbers as we look at them now, look as though we should come in about right. There shouldn’t be an overall increase above the number of beds available. The NHS I think has done an amazing job of increasing the capacity of ICU and so things seem to be tracking in the right direction, but I don’t think I can say more than that. I don’t know, Chris, whether you want to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (11:05);I agree."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (11:08);Laura, is that okay? Did you want to come back on any of it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Laura Kuenssberg: (11:11);Yeah. The Foreign Secretary Cabinet always, in theory, runs on collective responsibilities, but there are always times when, in the end, one person has to make the decision. In normal circumstances, the prime minister is the ultimate decision-maker. In these circumstances, are you that person or what happens if there is no agreement?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (11:30);Well, as I said, we’ve got collective cabinet responsibility but the arrangements are very clear. The prime minister has asked for me to deputize for him to start just starting the responsibilities for as long as he’s unable to do that. We’ve got in the discharge of those responsibilities and frankly the direction instructions, he’s given very clear plans. So we’re all focused with a unity of purpose in a clear and calm determination to get that done from the procurement of PPE, getting it to the front line to supporting businesses and all of the work in DFID and the foreign office that we’re doing out on the international level to reinforce that effort on the home front. Robert Peston, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Robert Peston: (12:12);Good afternoon. Mr Raab, you say that you have very clear instructions from the prime minister about what to do, but if there needed to be a significant change of direction, do you have the authority to make that change of direction or would you wait for the prime minister’s return? If I could ask Sir Patrick and Mr. Whitty, your own chart today does show the rates of growth in the number of deaths in Germany is much slower than the other European countries, including the UK that you cite. What is there that we can learn from Germany?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (12:56);Well, Rob, on your question to me, I’m being tasked when I was appointed, given very clear steer from the prime minister and obviously, as we’ve been going through this crisis, very clear instructions in terms of dealing with coronavirus. He’s asked me to deputize for him for as long as is necessary, but the normal Cabinet collective responsibility and principles that inform that will apply. Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (13:19);We look at all of the countries and try and understand what differences there are in terms of responses. We look right the way across the world in regular contact with the chief scientific advisors and chief medical officers in other countries to try and understand different approaches taken and different effects. You’re right, the German curve looks as though it’s lower at the moment and that is important. I don’t have a clear answer for you to exactly what it is the reason for that. There are obviously two things that one we’ll look at in terms of any response to any outbreak."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (13:51);One is the virus itself and the other is the society into which that virus comes. There are things to do with demographics, there are things to do with the way systems are organized and, of course, that may be differences in the way certain responses have been taken and we don’t know, but we’re in regular contact with the other countries. Again, I’ll see if Chris wants to add anything to that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (14:09);What I think that the one thing I’d add to that is we all know that Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus. There’s a lot to learn from that and we’ve been trying to learn the lessons from that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (14:20);Did you want to follow up there, Rob boy?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Robert Peston: (14:22);Well it was just, you didn’t quite say that you feel confident that if you had to make a change of direction and you weren’t able to communicate with the prime minister, would you have the confidence in doing that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (14:37);I’ve got total confidence in the arrangements that the prime minister has put in place so that I can discharge the responsibility for him, deputizing for him while he’s out of action. Obviously, we hope that we’ll be for a very limited period of time. Mark Austin from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Mark Austin: (14:52);Thank you very much indeed, foreign secretary. First and foremost, everyone on this program and everybody at Sky News send their very best to the prime minister. We wish him a speedy recovery. My question is this, the prime minister is in intensive care. The health secretary caught the virus, the chief medical officer caught the virus. We’re very pleased to see him back at work, but three key people responsible for telling the country how not to get it, got it. So with respect, and I mean it is with respect, how did it come to this and how was that allowed to happen?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (15:28);Because you have a virus which is totally indiscriminate. We follow, all of us, the guidance as carefully as possible, but it’s a very dangerous virus. It’s very contagious and it just goes to show that no one is impervious to it and we all need to follow the guidance, both to the letter and spirit. Did you want to come back? Mark?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Mark Austin: (15:57);Yeah. And Chris, does he have an answer?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (16:00);Well, the answer is exactly the same, really. We all know that this is an extremely easy virus to pass on. That is exactly why the lockdown was necessary. That was why the very large number of things that we’ve had to ask people to do and not do are in place because it is extremely easy to catch this virus and it is extremely easy to pass it on, even if people take really careful precautions in terms of things like washing their hands, which remains critical. So I think it’s a very clear illustration of the fact that this is why we’re having to do this to ensure that we protect the NHS and save the lives of other people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (16:38);Jason Groves from the Daily Mail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Jason Groves: (16:43);Thanks, Mr. Raab. You mentioned that you’ve had instructions from the PM. I wonder, have you had instructions about what he wants to do about the looming decision on whether to extend the lockdown and can you give the country any idea of what that might be? We’re seeing Germany and Austria level with people about how long things might take and how they might be lifted. A question for Sir Patrick, last month in that room you told us we were three or four weeks behind Italy. We’ve seen, given the shocking death told today, to still be getting a similar outcome to Italy. Are there things that we could and should have done or was this outcome always inevitable and are things we can do now to make a difference?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (17:27);Well, Jason, just in terms of the review, we’re not at that stage yet. We will take any decision when the time is right based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice. Our number one and our overriding focus right now, as has just been demonstrated by the previous question, is to remain absolutely focused on conveying the key message, which is everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance. We’ve got a long bank holiday, Easter weekend coming up, warm weather. We understand that people are making big sacrifices to follow this guidance. It is helping. It is contributing to our ability to tackle the coronavirus. The worst thing now would be to take our foot off the pedal to ease up on that and risk losing the gains that have been made. So it’s absolutely critical that people keep up that discipline and the vast majority will and we hope everyone will follow that example because it is the way to make sure we consolidate the progress we’ve made and don’t lose the progress we’ve made. Chris, [crosstalk 00:18:31]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (18:31);It was Patrick-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (18:31);Oh, it’s Patrick. Apologies."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (18:32);So this is a pandemic meaning it’s everywhere and that’s why we’re seeing it across many different countries and across all populations. We are probably three or four weeks behind Italy in terms of the outbreak. It doesn’t mean we end up with the same numbers and of course it’s important that as the ICU capacity has been built up, this idea of keeping the numbers below the ICU capacity, that’s absolutely critical. It’s also worth just reflecting on the fact that the most important thing we can do is to implement the measures that are in place now to keep this suppressed. That’s really, really important. It’s what we need to be focused on now. It’s how we’re going to come out the other side to be able to say that the numbers are under control and we can then move on to the next phase."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (19:21);Do you want to come back, Jason, on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Jason Groves: (19:24);Well, just to clarify, Mr. Raab, it sounds like the instructions you’re getting from the PM is that this lockdown is going to have to stay. We are going to have to keep our foot on the pedal for a few more weeks at least. Is that a fair interpretation?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (19:36);No, I think we’ve been clear all along. We’ll be guided by the evidence that are the measures that we put in place on social distancing, on everything else, the impact that they’ve had. Once we’ve got reliable data on that, which will come up in the days ahead, we can consider whether and when and how we want to take any further decisions. But our number one focus right now is to keep the discipline of compliance with those measures because it will help us make progress. That’s the way we’ll get through this crisis and get out the other side as quickly and as effectively as possible. Heather Stewart from The Guardian."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Heather Stewart: (20:13);Oh,hello. This is a follow up to Jason’s question, to some extent. Were you suggesting now there that we won’t see a three-week review of the lockdown measures as we were promised when they were put in place, that we won’t see that if the prime minister is still in hospital. Will you wait until he’s not in hospital to do that? Slightly more broadly that the modeling that was published on Friday with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested that measures might have to stay in place for many months, social distancing for many months, at least, they said, with periodic lockdowns in order to keep the outbreak within the capacity of the NHS? I wonder whether that seems plausible and whether it’s now time to level with people, with kids who are wondering whether they’re going to see their friends before the end of the summer term and so on, that this is going to have to go on for months, not weeks?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (21:02);Well, I think we have leveled with everyone from the outset. We’ve been as transparent as possible in relation to all of the data and all the information. That’s why we’ve got the chief scientific advisor and the chief medical officer here. But the critical thing is to take evidence-based decisions. So we’ve said that we will take any review once we’ve got the evidence, the measures are working and having the kind of impact taking us past the peak, which means that they can be responsibly done. We’re not at that stage yet. CMO, do you want to add anything?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (21:31);Anything I’d add is really what we said yesterday. I think it’s really important that we get to the point that we all are confident that we’re beyond the peak and then at that point, start making it clear what combination of things and over what period of time seems a sensible combination to take us through. Because as I said yesterday, there are a large number of different things we need to take into account here in terms of the impact on health, the direct effects of the virus itself and also the indirect effects on the health service more widely."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (22:02);Heather, do you want to follow up or anything else you want to-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Heather Stewart: (22:05);Yes. In terms of when we might see that review, it depends on when you feel you have enough and relevant enough data? We won’t necessarily see it [inaudible 00:22:17]"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (22:16);It’ll be evidence based and so we’ll rely on the evidence we get from the impact of the measures that have already been taken. As Chris said, what we need to do is get beyond the peak when we can responsibly take any further decisions based, as I said, on the evidence that we’ve got, we’ve set that position out all along and we want to follow it because it’s the right thing to do. Again, it’s the right thing to do to get as effectively and as quickly as possible through the coronavirus challenge. Joe Murphy from The Evening Standard."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Joe Murphy: (22:45);Mr. Raab, I join you in wishing the best to the prime minister and his recovery. Can you say how the government is doing on course to meet the target of 100,000 tests per day? As the man who’s now in charge, will you ensure personally it’s delivered by the end of the month? Professor Whitty, a lot of people are worried that care homes for the elderly are not getting the same support of other branches of the health and care service. Can you address such worries whether doctors and nurses will go into homes rather than simply [inaudible 00:23:20] patients, whether there’ll be medically qualified professionals going in and whether you can stop agency nurses from, or carers rather, from looking after more than one home and then risking spreading? Why are the deaths in care homes not included in the daily tally of figures?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (23:40);Thanks, Joe. So just on the most recent data that’s been released on tests, there were 14,000 in a single day and so that shows progress. We’ve had 7,500 NHS workers and their families tested and we’ve got nine drive through sites currently operational in Nottingham, Chessington, Greenwich, Wembley, Sandwell, Manchester, Belfast, Edgbaston and Glasgow and Cardiff will be the 10th, which will be open shortly. So we’re all making progress on that. In terms of the data, a question on RNS versus the NHS, I don’t know whether Sir Patrick, you wanted to address that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Sir Patrick: (24:16);I’m happy to do that. The international reporting standard for death, all the other countries are based on hospitalized deaths confirmed and that’s the same as the data that you’re seeing. The ONS data, which are important look at overall deaths on death certificates where coronavirus is mentioned so that they are not confirmed deaths necessarily. It’s important to have both of those, but that’s what the difference between the two numbers is."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Joe Murphy: (24:41);So is that on the care homes?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (24:42);On the care homes, so firstly, just to add to that, the ONS data does include care home deaths. The hospital data obviously does not, so it’s one of the key differences. In terms of the looking after the residents of care homes and indeed nursing homes, we’ve said right from the beginning that this is one of the most difficult things we have to do and one of the most important things we have to do. That needs to, in a sense, balance the needs to have the right nursing, medical and other care support for the care homes whilst minimizing people going into care homes unnecessarily because almost by definition, most residents of care homes are relatively vulnerable people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (25:25);It is important we get that balance right, that we protect people, for example, when they come back from hospital that they do get the right medical care. But as I said right at the beginning of this epidemic, care homes and nursing homes are going to provide us with some of the biggest challenges. We have seen already that over 9% of care homes have reported cases. I regret to say, I think the number will go up over time despite excellent work by the care homes staff, by nurses who go in and by doctors. I would encourage people not to go into care homes unless they need to."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (26:03);Rob Merrick from the Inde."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Rob Merrick: (26:04);Thank you very much, foreign secretary. A question first for Professor Whitty. The Independent has sent a letter to GPS from Jenny Harris, which appears to raise concerns that some highly vulnerable people who need to be shielded are not being shielded. We’ve spoken to the family of a 95-year-old deaf, blind woman who’s totally dependent on her daughter for care. She doesn’t meet the criteria, she’s been told. Are you concerned that there are many, many people out there who are not being shielded as they should and what are you going to do about that? And a question please, for you, Mr. Raab, returning to Joe’s question, the government made a promise to the British people last week that a 100,000 daily tests would be carried out by the end of the month. We learned yesterday that the antibody tests won’t be ready by that date. So can I just be clear? Are you now promising you will carry out 100,000 daily antigen tests, the test for the virus itself by the end of the month? If you can’t meet that commitment, will somebody carry the cap?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (27:03);Well, just on that, I think the health secretary was very clear on the target. What I’ve tried to set out is the progress that we’ve made. Clearly more work to do, but important that we’ve made the progress we have so far. Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (27:14);So the situation of shielding, is that there are broadly three groups of people who we’ve asked to do different things. There’s everybody who we really want to stay at home unless they’re going out for work, for necessary food and medicine, for medical care or for exercise. We’ve really been very clear about that because that is the way we protect everybody, including the people who are shielded. Then there’s a higher risk group of people who are people, on the whole, who are over 70 and have pre-existing health conditions, which makes up roughly 16 million people overall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (27:52);The recommendations are the same for those, but we really need them to do it for their own protection. It’s not just to protect the NHS and to protect wider society or that helps with that, but it also really helps to protect them. But there’s this particularly vulnerable group of around about just under 1.5 million people. The exact numbers are kind of being sorted out at the moment, who we are very keen to have the absolute minimum contact possible for quite a long period of time. I think what we’ve been very clear is that there’s a group of people who we are able to identify, which is the great majority, who have been identified and written to in the first wave and there’s a second wave of letters going out today from NHS digital, over this week, which is we have identified centrally from their medical records, this is necessary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (28:44);There are additional people that have been identified either by specialists, medical groups, or in some cases, by GPs who know that someone has got a group of conditions or a particular condition that isn’t on the list but makes them particularly vulnerable. But equally, so people are being added to the list as a result of that. Equally, there’ve been some people who will have taken a decision in discussion with their GP that they simply do not wish to be part of this, that the idea of being for many weeks completely cut off, at least physically, from a society except for the absolute basic necessities. Of course, we hope people will be linked to people by social media and other areas that this is not something they wish to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Chria Whitty: (29:26);This particularly, for example, might apply to people who have had a terminal diagnosis and doing palliative care and are on the last stages where they would just make a rational life decision that was not what they wish to do. So there will be people in terms around the big group who will have been identified. There will be some people who go into the shielding program who are not initially identified and there’ll be some people who initially were identified who either because their medical condition is different from how it has been centrally recorded or because of their own choices in discussion with their doctor who will choose not to be part of that. That was always something we expected to happen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (30:05);Did you have a follow up, Rob?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Rob Merrick: (30:07);Can I come back to you, Mr. Raab? I don’t think you really answered my question. Just to be clear, we know that the antibody tests will not be ready by the end of the month. Can you say, is your promise now today that the government will carry out 100,000 daily antigen tests by the end of the month?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-7","Dominic Raab: (30:23);Well, I’m not going to say anything different from what the health secretary’s already said. What I hope people understand is that we are striving every sinew to get both sets of tests to the highest level we can. That involves tapping the domestic sources and supplies, but also using the foreign office network. We’re teaming up with DFID and the Department for International Trade to try and get as many international suppliers. But of course, lots of these things are in very high demand, but we are doing everything we can on every front to get all of the testing capabilities we need. Yes, the health secretary’s 100,000 per day target still stands. Thank you all very much."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (00:00);Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for the daily briefing on our fight against coronavirus. I’m joined today by Dr. Yvonne Doyle, who is the medical director of Public Health England. Before Yvonne provides an update on the latest data from our COBRA coronavirus fact file, I’d like to update you on the steps that we are taking to defeat this pandemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (00:24);Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the ability of the NHS to cope. Throughout our response to coronavirus, we have been following the scientific and medical advice. We have been deliberate in our actions, taking the right steps at the right time. We’re also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff, and lifesaving equipment on the front line, provide the care when people need it most."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (01:05);The daily figures showed that a total of 152,979 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus. Of those, 29,474 have tested positive. The number of people admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus symptoms is now 10,767, whilst 3,915 of those are in London and 1,918 in the Midlands."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (01:39);Of those hospitalized in the UK, sadly, 2,352 have died. This is an increase of 563 fatalities since yesterday. The youngest of them was just 13 years old. All our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives. This is more tragic evidence that this virus does not discriminate."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (02:10);The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest threat our country has faced in decades, and we’re not alone. All over the world, we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. We recognize the extreme disruption, the necessary actions we are asking people to take, are having on their lives, their businesses, jobs, and the nation’s economy. I want to thank everyone across our whole country for the huge effort that is being made collectively in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. To the frontline workers treating and caring for patients, the people delivering supplies to their neighbors, and the millions staying at home, thank you. You are protecting the NHS and saving lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (03:00);I want to thank businesses too. Through your support for your workers and your communities, and through your willingness to support our health service, you are making a real difference, whether it’s INEOS building a new hand sanitizer plant near Middlesbrough in just 10 days, or UCL engineers working with Mercedes Formula One to build new continuous positive airway pressure machines which help patients to breathe more easily, or broadband providers giving their customers unlimited data to stay connected, or indeed, London’s ExCel Center being converted into the NHS Nightingale hospital with space for 4,000 patients. These are just a few of the examples of businesses from across our great nation supporting lifesaving work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (03:51);There are also thousands of businesses, large and small, which have worked with staff to ensure that they’re supported in the days and weeks ahead, whether that is through ensuring PHE guidelines are followed on site, implementing furlough schemes, carrying over annual leave, or providing the means to work from home. I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to all of those businesses, up and down the country, which are working to keep our economy going, so that when this crisis passes, and it will, we are ready to bounce back."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (04:27);Our businesses are doing all they can to support our people, and I want to make it clear that government, in turn, will do all it can to support our businesses. We have already taken unprecedented action to support businesses, safeguard jobs, and protect the economy. From today, businesses will start benefiting from 22 billion pounds in the form of business rates relief and grants of up to 25,000 pounds which are being paid into the bank accounts of the smallest high street firms."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (05:03);On Saturday, I said that we had provided funds to councils in England for grants to small businesses. As of today, these local authorities have received more than 12 billion pounds. This afternoon, I held a call with hundreds of local authorities across England and made clear that this money must reach businesses as quickly as possible, and I know that businesses across England have already started to receive these grants."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (05:33);We know high street banks are working really hard to support the UK through this period, including through mortgage holidays and increased credit facilities. Loans for businesses are also being issued through the COVID Business Interruption Loan Scheme since it came into operation last week. The Chancellor, together with Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, wrote to the chief executives of the UK banks to urge them to make sure that the benefits of the Loan Scheme are passed through to businesses and consumers. It would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (06:19);Just as the taxpayer stepped in to help the banks back in 2008, we will work with the banks to do everything they can to repay that favor and support the businesses and people of the United Kingdom in their time of need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (06:36);Of course, this is a brand-new scheme and, as with all new schemes, it will not be perfect from the outset. We are listening all the time. And in response to concerns that we’ve heard from businesses, we are looking at ways in which we can ensure they get the support they need. The chancellor will be saying more on this in the coming days.."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (06:59);It is crucial that when we overcome this crisis, as in time we will, that businesses are in a good position to move forward. Times are tough, and we have harder times ahead of us. But I know that together, we will pull through."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (07:20);Yvonne?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (07:21);Thank you, Secretary of State. I would like to present you with some slides just to give you an update on what is happening across the country and also with the health system. Could I have slide one, please? This shows a slightly concerning trend because we have seen an uptick in motor vehicle traffic. The message here really is people do need to stay at home. Most are doing the right thing, as you can see from the rapid decline in public transport use. Everyone needs to do that. The message here is we need to save lives and to protect the NHS, so please stay at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (08:04);Could I have slide two, please? This shows the number of new UK cases as of today. It is slightly concerning. It’s still too early to say whether the plateau of hospital admissions has ended, but we’ve now seen three days of increases in a row. Again, we need to protect the NHS, and the best way to do that is to stay at home, to avoid catching the disease yourself, and obviously avoid giving it to anyone else. That is the way that the NHS can continue to protect us."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (08:43);Could I have slide three, please? This slide shows the England hospital admissions. I think a lot of reporting has been about London, and you can see why on this slide. That’s where coronavirus is most advanced. But the chart shows that the threat is everywhere. We need to protect the NHS everywhere. The Midlands now is obviously a concern as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (09:12);Slide four, please. This is what it’s all about. It is about saving lives. This slide shows the global death comparisons. We need to save lives. As things stand, it has not been as severe here as in France, and we’re just tucked in under the USA, and obviously, Italy on a different trajectory, and Spain and United States, as we said. But there is no reason to be complacent. Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (09:47);Thank you, Yvonne. I think we’ll now move to the Q&A. The first question is from the BBC, Laura Kuenssberg. Laura?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Laura Kuenssberg: (09:54);Thank you very much, Secretary of State. The peak of this disease seems to be coming earlier than the government expected, but you are missing the testing targets. There’s a huge amount of evidence of staff not having the equipment they desperately need. There are not enough ventilators. Do you accept now that the approach and the response from government has just been too slow?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (10:16);Laura, thank you very much for that question. Can I just make it absolutely clear, and the prime minister has been very clear about this as well, is that increasing testing capacity is absolutely the government’s top priority. We’re now at 10,000 tests a day. We’re rolling out additional networks of labs and testing sites. In terms of PHE, over the last two weeks, 390 million products have been distributed. Of course, we will continue to do more and work to make sure that PHE is available. As you know, there is a hotline which is available, 24-hour hotline, for NHS staff as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (10:49);But Yvonne, if you wanted to comment on this, please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (10:52);Thank you, Secretary of State. Laura, there is positive news about this. The NHS and PHE committed to make 10,000 tests a day available. We have met that target by the end of March, early April, and we have some more capacity. Our commitment is actually to go to 25,000 tests a day, and we are confident, with our industry partners, that we will achieve that. That means patients are getting the tests they need, but there is also some spare capacity in that for testing the most urgent healthcare workers. Alongside that, as the Secretary of State has said, there is a second front opening and is already testing a couple of thousand healthcare workers in order of priority. So we are definitely increasing our testing capacity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (11:45);Thank you, Laura. Next question is from Sky, Beth Rigby. Beth?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Beth Rigby: (11:50);Thank you. A question first for Yvonne Doyle. Can you give us the number and proportion of frontline NHS staff who’ve been tested for coronavirus? You said 2,000. Is that out of half a million frontline NHS workers. And how are you intending to scale that up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Beth Rigby: (12:07);And if I may, to the Secretary of State, the prime minister said nearly two weeks ago he wanted to get to quarter of a million tests a day. That was the virus and antibody tests. Latest daily figure is 10,412 tests. Why is it taking so long for reality to match the rhetoric? And will you give a clear timeframe as to when you will deliver on the prime minister’s promise? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (12:31);Well, Yvonne, could I ask you to take that first?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (12:31);Thank you, Secretary of State."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (12:33);Beth, the number of tests undertaken in the NHS-Public Health England combined testing capacity is just increasing at the moment, so that would be a relatively small number. But there is capacity, for example, today for almost 3,000, and that will increase as we get to 25,000, to that capacity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (12:55);The important capacity is in the second strand, where we will have five centers where people can drive through and get their testing done in order of priority. NHS chief executives are identifying that priority. The intention here is to get from thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks. We are very committed to our NHS frontline staff. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (13:20);Yvonne, thank you for that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (13:21);I think, Beth, Yvonne has explained the details in terms of ramping up testing. You made particular reference to the antibody tests. What I can say on that is, of course, we are urgently evaluating that test, and it is an absolute priority. And of course, this is about making sure that people who have the test can find out whether they’ve had the virus and are now immune to it. The chief scientific officer has said that the accuracy of this test is incredibly important, so it’s also important that we get this right before we launch the test itself."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (13:55);Thank you for that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (13:56);The next question is from ITV, Robert Peston. Robert?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Robert Peston: (14:01);Hello. Good afternoon. Largely a question, I think, for Yvonne Doyle. Yvonne, I reported this afternoon that a million antibody tests are arriving from China in the coming few days. They have been paid for by the government. The government has said it won’t pay for anything that it doesn’t think works. But I am told that PHE, Public Health England, is dragging its feet in giving its approval to the use of these tests. I’m also told that these tests would be an alternative to PCR and would actually detect active virus, for example, in frontline staff. When will they be in hospitals for use?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (14:43);Thank you, Robert. The important thing about these antibody tests… This is not a matter of dragging our feet. It’s important that the test is valid, that it does what it says it does. As the chief medical officer said, something worse than no test is a wrong test or a bad test. That is what is being tested at the moment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (15:02);In the meantime, there is a separate strand which is very important, which is called zero prevalence, where our own labs are testing the validity of whether the blood samples we’re getting very generously from people who’ve had the disease, but also from Blood and Transplant and from the College of GP’s surveillance scheme, whether those tests are also valid, and we are very pleased about that. So I would say, Robert, as soon as we can, we want to be out there doing these tests."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (15:33);Thank you. Thank you, Robert. Thank you, Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (15:36);The next question is from the Evening Standard, from Joe Murphy. Joe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Robert Peston: (15:41);Hello. May I ask Yvonne Doyle, if 2,000 NHS staff have been tested so far and 125,000 are self-isolating, or thereabout, that’s, by my reckoning, 1.6%, can I pin you to a target for the improvement that you promised in the previous answer? What, for example, will that number look like in one week from today? And do you think people are getting complacent about the measures that have been put in?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Robert Peston: (16:09);And Mr. Sharma, I think a lot of us feel that we haven’t yet been given a full and practical explanation of why Germany is able to test many times more than the UK. Do they have more labs, more equipment? Are they making better use of universities or the private sector than us, and if so, why? Or are they using a different, perhaps a quicker test? And what are the reagents that we’re struggling to get? We’re looking to work out, is this a capacity issue for Germany versus the UK, or is it a political choice that’s made to test fewer people?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (16:42);Yvonne, I’m wondering whether you might take that first."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (16:46);I presume you’re talking about the healthcare worker frontline testing. The intention there, as I say, is to go from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. That will have to go on the basis of the priority that is identified as to which of these workers are actually needed… When I say workers, they’re really staff or colleagues… are needed in which settings, particularly where the sickest patients are, and they will be tested first. That is the intention over the coming weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (17:15);While I’m speaking, do you wish me to speak about the reagents?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (17:17);Yes, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (17:18);Just about the reagents, so the reagents are generally produced by the manufacturers of the machines, and so the reagents that work best are those that work with the machines that they’re intended for. That’s the most efficient. We are working with the industry to ensure that that supply is good and that the machinery is most efficient. But as the head of the industry has said, there is a global market in this, but they are committed to working with the UK government and with us to ensure that we get those tests through as quickly. And there is complimentary work going on to ensure that we can supplement that if needed, and that is very exciting for the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (18:01);Joe, I think you made reference to Germany. We, of course, look to see where we can learn throughout this process. Of course, we are working with industry, we’re working with the scientific community to make sure that we have maximum possible supplies."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (18:14);But I just go back to the point that Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, made some days ago when she said we are looking to create a lab-based testing on a scale which is comparable to building a medical equivalent of a car factory. We are trying to do something at huge scale very fast, but I think as you’ve heard from Yvonne, we are making progress, we will continue to make progress, and we are determined to make sure that we have the supplies and provide the support that we can for people across the UK, and particularly the most vulnerable and those key workers in the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (18:53);Thank you very much for that, Joe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (18:54);The next question is from Financial Times, from Laura Hughes. Laura?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Laura Hughes: (18:59);Good afternoon. Can I ask, what is the government’s exit strategy for getting us out of this lockdown, and what role will testing play in that? Jeremy Hunt has called for mass community testing. Is it too late for that, or is that the government’s policy and one that we’ll see being carried out over the next few weeks and months?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (19:20);Yeah. Well, thank you for that, Laura. Let me just say a few words before I pass on to Yvonne on this. Of course, people understand across the country why we have put these restrictions in place, and the prime minister was very clear they were for an initial three-week period and we would review them. But what’s also really important is that if we stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that effort that people have made, that massive effort people have made across the country, is wasted, and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (19:59);But I think it may be helpful, Yvonne, if you want to amplify on this particular point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (19:59);Thank you, Secretary of State. The prime minister has committed to taking review of this after Easter, and I think it’s important to say that we are looking at this through the scientific lens, as well through modeling and through the information we’re getting from clinical cases, as to how this epidemic is progressing. We will be guided by that, Laura. We obviously wanted to make the right call at the right time on this, and it is something that we have to keep reviewing every week. Certainly, we’re very close to SAGE and the modeling on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (20:31);But in terms of the mass testing, which is your other point here, the testing strategy is to increase the amount of testing done, not just in healthcare workers but in the population. But the rate-limiting step there is not us. It’s really whether the tests are valid, and then to get that out and about, and aided by technology. I think that will change as the phases of this epidemic change. We will perhaps use different techniques. In the beginning, at the containment phase, this was very professional people dependent in the community. We obviously would want this to go faster as we come to a different phase of the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (21:16);Thank you for that, Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (21:17);We have one final question, which is from BuzzFeed, from Emily Ashton. Emily?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Emily Ashton: (21:22);Hi."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (21:23);Hi."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Emily Ashton: (21:23);This is a question for both of you, I think. NHS frontline workers across the country are showing extraordinary courage in showing up at hospitals day after day in horrific circumstances. You may have seen today a joint statement from trade unions saying the lack of personal protective equipment has become a crisis within a crisis. Workers are being put at unnecessary risk, and also going into work not knowing whether they have been infected by this virus or not, and maybe wondering why we weren’t preparing for testing much earlier. The government keeps offering them warm words, and we’ve heard more of those this evening, but do you accept that you are putting those workers into a dangerous situation and really need to act urgently to keep them safe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (22:07);Emily, thank you for that. You’re absolutely right. I pay tribute to the amazing work that NHS staff in the front line across the whole of the NHS and across the public service are doing at this time to support us and support the population."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (22:22);Specifically on the point of PPE, I think as I said in response to an earlier question, over the past two weeks, we have delivered over 390 million PPE products. We have ensured that these are being delivered to every GP practice, to dentists, community pharmacies. There is also now a 24-hour NHS-run hotline where NHS and social care workers can call and request that PPE if it’s needed. Of course, we will continue to do as much as we can, more, to get more of this equipment to the front line, because at the end of the day, you are absolutely right, this is about helping and supporting those who are making a difference in helping and supporting our population."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (23:04);Yvonne?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Dr. Yvonne Doyle: (23:05);Thank you, Secretary of State. Emily, it is absolutely our commitment to protect frontline staff, and we are in touch with a wide range of leaders, clinical leaders, nursing leaders, community leaders, and the trade unions, and they are aware of our intention. We are working very rapidly at the moment to ensure that the deliveries reach where they’re needed, and good stocktaking on that, and also that our guidance is easily understood and people understand what they actually need to keep them safe in the circumstances they’re in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-1","Alok Sharma: (23:39);Great. Well, thank you very much. I think that was our last question. Could I just end by saying, is that we do request that everybody follows the government guidelines. Ultimately, this is about staying at home, protecting the NHS, and saving the lives, and we will get through this working together. Thank you."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (01:50);Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s coronavirus press briefing. I’m joined by our deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan van Tam and by the chief nurse Ruth May. Our plan is to save as many lives as possible by protecting the NHS and preventing it from being overwhelmed and we’re doing this in two ways."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (02:17);One, by slowing the spread of the virus. That’s why it is so important that people stay at home. And that’s true for everyone who’s watching, how important it is that we stay at home. And two, by boosting the capacity of NHS to care for those who fall sick. That means more beds, more staff, more life saving equipment, and more effective treatments will come on to that. Coronavirus continues its grim march. I could report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program, according to the latest figures as of this morning, a total of 173,784 people who’ve been tested, of whom 38,168 tested positive. 3,605 people sadly died. And we’re reminded again today that for the NHS, this truly is the front line."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (03:28);In the last 24 hours, two nurses and two healthcare assistants tragically died fighting Coronavirus. Every life lost to this dreadful disease makes me more determined than ever to push for victory. And today, I want to update you with the latest on what we’re doing to boost NHS capacity. So the capacity we have to care is always above the need for that care. First, we’re delivering more critical care beds. This morning, I attended the opening of the new Nightingale Hospital in East London, with Ruth and many others. It was planned, constructed, and fully staffed in just nine days. That is an outstanding achievement and I pay tribute to Ruth and all who’ve been involved in its construction. It shows what’s possible when we come together as one team in one national effort, I pay tribute to the extraordinary work of everyone, the NHS, the military, the construction industry who both donated supplies and of course their expertise, the engineers, the electricians, the plumbers, the caterers, and others all playing their part to build a place of hope and a place of healing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (04:52);It was really inspiring to go and see the sheer scale of it and the teamwork going on there. And lastly, I want to thank you. I want to thank everyone who is at home because you are giving the NHS the time to expand so that it can save lives. By staying at home, you are saving lives. We have more Nightingale Hospitals planned and on the way in Birmingham and Manchester and Glasgow, and today we’ve announced that we will begin the work on two further Nightingale Hospitals in Bristol and Harrogate. The Bristol Nightingale will have a capacity of up to a 1,000 beds and in Harrogate the capacity of up to 500. The Nightingale Hospitals are not the only expansion we’ve seen across the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (05:49);Since the start of this crisis, we’ve boosted the number of critical care beds to care for coronavirus by over 2,500. That’s before the addition we’ll get from the Nightingale Hospitals. And the result of this extraordinary work is that in every hospital in the country, we have managed to expand capacity. And as we stand today, over 2,000 critical care beds are free and available and they’re ready should they be needed. And that’s before the Nightingale Hospitals come on stream. And of course, we’re working round the clock to deliver essential deliveries of PPE across the whole NHS, across social care, key public services, and in all four nations of the UK. Yesterday, more than 26 million PPE products delivered to 281 different organizations."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (06:47);And I’ve agreed with the Northern Ireland executive that we will immediately be providing more PPE to Northern Ireland to meet their needs, over 5 million items, including goggles and aprons and masks. Over 7,000 NHS staff have now been tested. And next alongside testing, we’re intensively researching drugs and treatments. Right since the start of this crisis, we’ve been clear that all our plans are based on the best possible science and that science gets better every day. But there’s still a lot that we don’t know about how to treat and potentially prevent COVID-19. So research about treatments is absolutely central to our plan. The UK of course has a long tradition that we’re very proud of, of being the best in the world in this sort of science. And we are a world leader in clinical trials and we’re putting this to use right now, bringing together some of the finest research minds in the country to design new trials and we’re delivering them at record pace as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (07:56);We’ve established three national clinical trials covering each major stage of the disease, primary care, hospital care, and critical care for the most seriously ill. And just like the Nightingale, one of these trials was in fact put together in just nine days, which is breathtaking speed. These trials are looking at the effects of existing drugs and steroids repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. One of the trials which is called recovery, which deals in hospital care is the largest of its kind in the world with 926 patients enrolled. We’ve also set up an expert therapeutics task force to search for and shortlist other candidate medicines for trials and I’m advised on that work by my brilliant colleague Jonathan van Tam, the deputy chief medical officer who is one of the finest research scientists of his generation. And Jonathan will say a bit more about in a few minutes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (08:57);We need more patients to volunteer to be part of these trials because the bigger the trials, the better the data, and the faster we can roll out the treatments, if and only if it’s proven to work. These treatments will help us as the science develops. But for now, the only way to protect yourself and your family from this disease is to stay at home. And of course while this is a national effort to find these treatments, it’s also an international effort, in the same way that we’ve donated more money to the global search for a vaccine than any other country. So too, we will lead the world in the science of these treatments. And whatever we learn, we will share because we are all on the same side in this war."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (09:48);Earlier today I spoke to my counterparts in G7 to coordinate our research efforts over this and other things. And whether it’s treatments or equipment or NHS capacity, we will strain every city. We will move whatever mountains need to be moved. We need everyone to keep playing their part and that includes you. The only way to protect yourselves and others now is to stay at home. The one final thing I want to say is this. We’re set for a warm weekend in some parts of the country, but the disease is still spreading and we absolutely cannot afford to relax the social distancing measures that we have in place. We cannot relax our discipline now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (10:40);If we do, people will die. So I end with the advice that we all know. This advice is not a request. It is an instruction. Stay at home, protect lives, and then you will be doing your part. I’m now going to hand over to Ruth May, the chief nurse to say a little bit about the Nightingale Hospital and then to Jonathan van Tam to talk about the treatments and the data that we’ve got. Ruth?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth May: (11:15);Thank you, Secretary of State. Before I talk about the Nightingale Hospital in London, I want to recognize that today we’ve had the very sad news of the loss of two of my colleagues. We have lost today, Amy [inaudible 00:11:33] and [inaudible 00:11:34], two registered nurses working to protect our public and they sadly have died. My sincere condolences to their families, their friends, and their colleagues because they were one of us. They one of my profession, of the NHS family."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth May: (11:59);I worry that there’s going to be more and I want to honor them today and recognize their service. So as the Secretary of State said, we were with the [inaudible 00:12:20]. And his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, he was joining via video cameras as he opened the first NHS Nightingale Hospital in London. It was an extraordinary feat. People have worked so hard from all sorts of walks of life, all sorts of backgrounds, and they’ve come together as one team to build an NHS hospital. An enormous piece of work, of absolute huge. As the Secretary of State has said, he’s announced two further facilities in Harrogate for the people of the Northeast and in Bristol for the people of the Southwest. And of course that’s long side, Birmingham and Manchester. So thank you to all of our NHS staff, all of our staff across into social care, whether that’s nurses, midwives, doctors, all of them pulling together to make sure that we continue to prepare for COVID-19 surge. I’m grateful for all of our frontline staff and all of our support staff who are caring as a team for sick patients."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth May: (13:26);I’m very grateful to you, the British public, for your patience and in helping our NHS. As the Secretary of State said, this weekend is going to be very warm and it’s very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays. But please, I ask you to remember Amy and [inaudible 00:13:48]. Please stay at home for them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (13:53);Thank you, Ruth. And Jonathan van Tam, if you could bring us up to speed on the treatments and on the latest data that we have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (14:01);Thank you, Secretary of State. I’ll begin with the data-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (14:03);and the first slide I want to show you is a survey which shows the behavioral change as of 29th of March in relation to the social-distancing advice that the government has given."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (14:18);As you can see on the slide, if you begin on the left, there is a small increase in mobility within residential settings. This actually is good because it shows people are staying at home. If you then contrast that with the bars further to the right which move progressively through grocery and pharmacy, through public parks, through workplaces, through transit stations and finally to retail and recreation, you can see progressively larger declines in mobility across the UK. This is really very encouraging indeed and shows that the British public are following the advice that was given, to them but it needs to continue. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (15:04);If you then move on and you look at the change in transport use between the 5th of March and just a few days ago, you can see dramatic declines across the piece in total motor vehicles and in use of national rail, buses, and tubes in London. This again is very encouraging. Next slide, please. However, as we have always said, we do not expect these changes to turn the curve on this awful disease immediately. It will take time. As you can see, this slide shows the number of UK cases by day and you can see the numbers are increasing. This remains a dangerous time. It remains vitally important that people continue to stay at home and practice the social distancing that we’ve asked of them, even this weekend as the weather turns warmer. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:09);You will see a similar picture for hospital admissions, that they are increasing and again, this reinforces the advice we give. The final slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:22);Shows the comparison of the UK in relation to various other countries. The index is set at the first day in each country when 50 deaths were reported. You can see from this slide that it is a global battle and that the UK is in the same situation in terms of the curve and the shape of the curve as many, many other countries around the world. This is a serious battle. We need to keep fighting it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:57);I’d now like to talk about clinical trials, if you could take the slide down. Thank you. The first thing I want to say is that this is a new disease where at the moment we do not have any proven treatments. The UK is absolutely determined, however, to find effective treatments for this virus disease. Weeks ago we began to look at clinical trials. We may not have publicized it at that point, but a lot of work has been going on for weeks behind the scenes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (17:37);Clinical trials are a gold standard way to discover if a treatment works or not, but saying whether it works or not is rather too simplistic. The treatment has to be effective. It also has to be safe and we also have to understand the right dosage to use, the right patients to give the treatment to, and the right time in the illness to give that treatment. This is complicated stuff and the only way to unpick the signal and make sure we get it right is through clinical trials."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (18:18);And as my colleague, the secretary of state, has said, there are three trials already up and running in the UK that target different places in the patient pathway from primary care through to critical care. The recruitment rate has been absolutely astonishing, particularly in the recovery trial where we are at 926 patients some three weeks after the trial began. It’s astonishing. It really is a fantastic tribute to the fact that the NHS is getting on with delivering care, but at the same time is committed to finding the right effective treatments."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (19:02);Now, again, as the secretary of state has said, our initial focus has been on what we call “repurposed medicines,” medicines that are already licensed for some other use or indication. An example would be hydroxychloroquine, which is a malaria drug. Another example in our clinical trials would be a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, which is an HIV treatment. We are going for the foreground targets in the first instance, where we already have a drug that is licensed. But we’re just not stopping there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (19:39);We are determined in the next round of clinical trials to move on to new medicines, ones that are in what we call Phase Two or Phase Three development now possibly for something else but which might have a role to play. We’re going to explore all of those technologies. To do this, we are going to need this therapeutics task force that we have set up to keep an oversight and to coordinate this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (20:07);Now, I know that there’ll be a question about when are we going to get some results from these clinical trials. My straight answer to you is, I don’t know. I think it’s going to be a few months, but it will all depend upon how quickly patients are recruited into the trials across the NHS. The faster we go in getting bigger numbers in the trials, the clearer and more emphatic and more granular signals we will get about what works and who it works for."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (20:42);Thank you, Secretary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (20:43);Thank you very much. If we now go to questions, the first question is going to be from Hugh Pym of the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Hugh Pym: (20:54);Thank you very much. It’s a question actually for Jonathan Van Tam, if I may. When do you expect the peak of the epidemic to be? At that point, will the NHS have enough ventilators to give those who need critical care that care at a time when some patients might fear they won’t be able to get it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (21:14);Thank you for the two questions. The first one is about when we will turn this curve round, when we are going to peak, and when we’re going to come down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (21:24);We don’t know the answer to that yet. We have always said that we will know if our social- distancing measures are working a few weeks after we have put them in place. By my quick calculation, we’re at kind of 10 or 11 days at the moment. It’s too soon to say. It will partly depend upon how well those social-distancing measures are adhered to by every one of us, but I hope it will be soon. We are going to watch very carefully to see when we’ve hit the peak and when we’re starting to turn it, but we will not take any premature actions. We’re going to stick with the science and see where it takes us."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (22:07);Your second question, is kind of related and about how tall the peak will be and whether there will be enough ventilator capacity across the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (22:19);I can tell you that I don’t think we’re anywhere close to that kind of scenario at the moment. We will watch it extremely closely and we will make decisions as we need to on a day-by-day basis. But I repeat, we are not anywhere close to the scenario you describe at the moment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (22:40);Thanks very much. If we go to Robert Peston of ITV. Hi, Robert."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Robert Peston: (22:46);Afternoon, gentlemen. Firstly, on the clinical trials, Jonathan Van Tam said the success depends to a certain extent on the numbers enrolled in those trials. Was that actually a call to individuals with symptoms to enroll in those trials? Are you looking for volunteers?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Robert Peston: (23:03);Secondly, very recently, Patrick Vallance told the health select committee that on the basis of the lag between infections and deaths, he thought there were probably a thousand people in the community with this virus for every death. Does that mean we think that we’re not far off four-million people infected, or have you’ve got a new rule of thumb now that we’re slightly further on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Robert Peston: (23:28);Then, finally, Secretary of State, you’re well aware, because of ministers and people you know, that the range of symptoms you can get with this is very broad indeed. For example, there’s a lot of evidence that losing sense of smell and taste is a symptom. Are you looking at changing the guidelines to people for when they quarantine, because at the moment you’re saying self-isolate if it’s a high fever and a cough, but are you going to add to the list of symptoms where people should start self isolating?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (24:01);Well, thank you. If I answer some of that and then I’ll cast over to JVT. On the last one, which you addressed directly to me, Robert, it’s a complimentary of you to ask me a scientific medical question, but I’m going to resist the temptation to answer it because we’ve got a proper medical scientist in the room and we are following the science. For me, personally, I did lose my sense of taste and that actually has begin to come back though. I can assure people who have lost their sense of taste that the good news is that that, in my case, wasn’t permanent."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (24:42);On the first point about the clinical trials, the answer is that we are looking for people to sign up to the clinical trials where that’s possible within that hospital and where that is clinically advised. The call really is to the NHS, who are the ones who would make recommendations that somebody would be on a clinical trial."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (25:07);JVC, do you want to add to those two questions and also answer Robert’s middle question on the rate of infection."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (25:13);Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. I will answer those questions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (25:16);On the point about loss of taste and smell and nausea, we have actually asked our expert advisory committee NERVTAG to look at this, and there are some anecdotal data that are now in the published domain that suggests that a proportion of people do indeed lose their sense of taste and smell. However, we have looked at the data that there are in relation to whether that on its own is a symptom that would be important to add to the case definition. The answer to from our experts is absolutely not, that, yes, this is true. Well, as far as we can tell on limited data, it appears to be true, but It doesn’t contribute anything on its own to the overall affinity of the diagnosis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (26:11);On the second point about volunteers for clinical trials, people will have read in the newspapers sometimes when a new drug is being tried that there’s an advert and you ring up and you volunteer for the clinical trial. This is a very different scenario. Here, these are about patients who are undergoing treatment at some stage for COVID-19."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (26:35);First of all, we need the physicians in charge of their care to sign up for the clinical trial and then it is up to the physicians to approach the patient and ask them if they would like to take apart. It’s a process of very careful, written, informed consent for that to happen. But the straight answer is, yes, we do need people to take part in the clinical trials and they are doing. For the recovery trial, yesterday’s figure reported to me was a little over 700 patients into the trial. Today, I’m walking on my way to 10 Downing street and the number comes through of 926. This is really fantastic work by both clinicians and by patients."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:26);On your final point about are there more people out there than we are counting through the case numbers, our testing is based primarily at the moment in hospitals where it is needed most, and there will be further cases out there, people who are isolating in accordance with the guidelines, who have COVID-19 who we have not counted in the official statistics. How large that is, I wouldn’t like to speculate."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (28:00);Any follow-ups to that, Robert?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Robert Peston: (28:03);Well, it was simply that-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Robert Peston: (28:03);[inaudible 00:28:04] did use a ratio of one to a thousand. I mean, it was a rule of thumb that he thought was useful. Do you have a rule of thumb at the moment? Or do you personally, Jonathan, think that’s not terribly helpful."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:18);It’s not that I don’t think it’s terribly helpful. That’s the official advice we’ve had through the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, but obviously there’s a lot of imprecision associated with those kinds of estimates. And I think it’s probably unhelpful at this point to try and nail it down, as it were."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (28:33);I think that another way to add to that is that pillar four of the testing strategy is having survey tests to try to find the answer to that question as scientifically as possible. And there’s a huge amount of work under way under pillar four. If we go to Sam Coates, from Sky, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Sam Coates: (28:58);Thank you. To Matt Hancock, earlier today, you seem to indicate that you did think that Easter Sunday, April the 12th would be the projected peak for coronavirus deaths, but Jonathan Van-Tam doesn’t seem to quite endorse that when speaking just now. Why is that? What’s going on there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Sam Coates: (29:16);And secondly, to all of you, there are people, some elderly, some disabled, being told by GP’s today that they fit into the category of do not resuscitate. That they wouldn’t be taken to hospital, that they won’t be treated. What do you say to them, to their families? Should they fight those do not resuscitate messages and notices? Or should they just accept what they’re told?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (29:38);Thank you. On the first one of those, the truth is that we don’t know. I think you’ve over interpreted my comment. I was asked about a suggestion earlier. And I answered the same, which is that we don’t know. And actually, there’s a reason we don’t know. And that was because it depends on how people act. And this is why the absolute central message, the most important message that anybody can take away from this press conference or the entirety of the government’s messaging and how we feel is that you’ve got to stay at home. And I know we repeat this, but it is really important. Because the more people stay at home, the faster that we will get through this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (30:28);On the question of DNRs, I’ll hand over to Ruth."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth: (30:35);Yep. Absolutely. So, clinicians, my clinical colleagues have these discussions all of the time with patients and their families thinking about their wishes, thinking about what their care being planned. And that’s right and proper. COVID-19 is no excuse to have those discussions. And in an insensitive way. But these discussions need to happen all of the time with families and with patients themselves. But it needs to be done sensitively. And COVID-19 should not be used as an excuse to do that quite separately."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (31:12);Thanks very much. If we go to Liz Bates of Channel 4. Hi, Liz."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Liz Bates: (31:17);Hi. If I could direct my questions primarily at Matt Hancock. First of all, you hugely based expectations when you said 3.5 million antibody tests had been ordered and would be widely available. Now you’re saying they don’t work? Are these tests ever going to materialize."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Liz Bates: (31:37);And secondly, if I may, countries which have carried out more tests and the U.K. Have had fewer deaths per million. Has the decision to carry out fewer tests than places like Germany and South Korea cost lives here?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (31:52);Thanks. I can take both those questions. We have provisionally ordered 17 and a half million, not three and a half million antibody tests. But, as I’ve been absolutely clear all along, we’ll only use them if they work. And, in fact, on the G7 call earlier, it’s clear that no G7 country has yet found a home antibody test, which is pillar three of the testing strategy, that works. But we continue to search for one. Again, this is an area where the science is constantly developing. And there’s a huge amount of global effort going into finding one of these tests that does work. But I’ve also been clear that we’re putting the orders in place so that, should they work, then we can get them here in the U.K."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (32:41);And on the second point, can you remind me of the second question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Liz Bates: (32:50);That we haven’t tested."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (32:52);It was about the numbers testing. Yeah. The truth is, we’ve had a clear ramp up in testing as part of the strategy from the start. We had just under 2,000 tests a day a month ago. I set the goal of reaching 10,000 a day. And we have reached that. And we hit that on target at the end of March. And now, we’ve got the clear goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (33:24);There are countries that have tested more than us, like Germany as you mentioned. But there’s others, like France, that haven’t tested as much as us. The question of the correlations is a very complicated one with lots of factors in it. I don’t know if you want to add anything, JVT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:43);Yeah. So, I would add just something, Secretary of State, on the quality of tests. It’s absolutely vitally important. Any test in medicine, any test is never a hundred percent accurate. That is a truism. And the wrong antibody test that isn’t accurate is going to say to some people you have antibodies when you don’t. It is also going to say to another selection of the population. You are not immune when you are. And so, it’s really important that these are rigorously evaluated so that the tolerances on those error rates are very low, indeed. And we have to get that right before we can even think about how we can use these antibody tests in the most advantageous and informative way for everyone."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (34:40);Thanks very much. Andy Bell, Channel 5."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Andy Bell: (34:44);Thank you very much. A quick follow up to you, Mr. Hancock, a follow up to Liz’s question. Have we spent any money on those 17 million tests we’ve ordered? And then, a question for professor Van-Tam, twice this week. One of your colleagues, Steven Powers from NHS England, has talked about seeing green shoots. Is that the way you would characterize what you’re seeing at the moment in the data?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (35:09);Well, on the first question, of course. The samples that we’ve got in, we’ve needed to pay for those samples because they’re being tested. But what matters here really is these tests. If we can get them, if they’re accurate, if they can work, if we’ve got the confidence in them that we can use them, then the positive impact that will have on people, knowing with confidence that they can get back to normal life more quickly, will vastly outweigh any cost. So, of course, cost is a consideration, but frankly getting a test that works, it is worth more than just more than just money. JVT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:56);Thank you. On the green shoots, the answer to your question is, where you look for them. I absolutely see green shoots. I really do in terms of the massive change in public behavior that’s already taken place. If that continues, for as long as the government asks for it to continue, then they really will be quite big green shoots in the end."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:24);However, if you’re asking me about the health care hospital admission data, then I think it is too early to make any kind of interpretation such as that. There will be day to day variations in the number of hospital admissions that occur as a feature of near random chance. And so, one mustn’t interpret the data. One needs to be patient and look for a long term trend."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (36:53);Thanks very much. We’re going to go to Martin Brown of The Express. Hi, Martin."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Martin Brown: (36:59);Hi there. Thank you. Mr. Hancock, can I ask what measures, what help is being given to the mental wellbeing of thousands of patients who are in hospital on their own, many of whom are sadly dying without their loved ones by their side? And the same goes also for pregnant women, as well, women giving birth. What help is being given to their mental wellbeing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Martin Brown: (37:23);And for the medical experts, can I just ask, is there any benefit in wearing a face mask, the public wearing face masks when they go outside? Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore where the use of face masks is more prevalent in the public, they seem to have lower levels of infections and deaths from coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (37:45);Thanks, Martin. I really worry about the impact of coronavirus on the mental health of those who are badly affected. And I really feel for those who have seen their loved ones die and not been able to be with them at the end. And I think it’s a really difficult issue that we have to make sure that we support people with compassion and understanding for what they’re going through."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (38:17);We have put five million pounds into Support Mind to help people with the impact of coronavirus on their mental health. But this is going to be, I think, an issue of increasing importance as the crisis goes on. I’m going to ask Ruth to say something about that, and also about the maternity question. And then, if JVT answers the second question. Ruth."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth: (38:43);Thank you very much. I was only on a phone call this morning to Sebastian, who is a doctor, a medical colleague of mine. And he had lost his father from COVID-19. And hearing his story about the extraordinary lengths that the nurses, the matron on that night shift had gone to to make sure that they were able to connect a conversation with his brother in Singapore, to be able to connect, to make sure the battery was fully charged for his dad to be able to have numerous phone calls."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth: (39:15);I am seeing, across the United Kingdom, nurses, midwives, the whole of our clinical teams going to extraordinary lengths to make sure we absolutely do that. And whilst we know that visiting has been reduced to the absolute limit, it is also… we are saying that visitors are able to go, of course, for people end of life care. But technology is really important. But looking on the wellbeing of our patients is really important, but also wellbeing of our staff. We need to make sure that we’re assessing out measures to look after our staff as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth: (39:48);I didn’t get quite the maternity question, Secretary of State. So, would you mind repeating that one?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Martin Brown: (39:55);It was just the same really. What help is being given to the women who are alone in hospital without their loved ones giving birth."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth: (40:06);Well, I’m very fortunate to work with professor Jackie Dunkley-Bent, our chief midwifery officer who provides enormous, fantastic midwifery leadership across England. What she’s been telling me is that midwives, yes, again, are doing exactly the same. They’re going to extraordinary lengths to make sure they’re using technology, using Zoom, using all of the technology to make sure people are connected. There’s been plenty of people that are doing just that to make sure that families can get together, when they can, safely to connect with their new members of their families."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (40:39);Thanks, Ruth. On the second question, JVT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (40:41);Yeah. I’ll just begin on the first, actually, to say, I realize this is an awful and distressing illness. And I’m very distressed personally when I hear these stories of families separated, when I hear everything that’s going on in that space. It’s really terrible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (41:01);But to your evidence point about face masks and wearing of face masks by the general public, this has been a controversial area in pandemic preparedness and planning for the 15 years that I’ve been involved in it. And, indeed, I was on the phone this morning to a colleague in Hong Kong who is a professor there who has done the evidence review for the World Health Organization on face masks. And we’re of the same mind that there is no evidence that general wearing of face masks by the public who are well affects the spread of the disease in our society. What matters right now, of course, is social distancing. And yes, it is true that we do see very large amounts of mask wearing, particularly in Southeast Asia. But we have always seen that for many decades-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (42:03);…and it is entirely wired into some cultures that masks are worn quite frequently in open spaces. So it’s very different, but in terms of the hard evidence and what the UK government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (42:24);Thanks very much. I hope that answers the question, Martin. Pretty clear. Dan Martin from The Mail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Dan Martin: (42:32);Mr. Hancock, you said that if people don’t obey the rules, you would consider toughening the lockdown that’s in place at the moment. In France, they’re stationing police in railway stations and installing multiple checkpoints to check where people are going. Is that the sort of thing we might see happening here? To the scientists, the Institute of Biomedical Science has come out today to say that the April target is practically impossible because they don’t have the equipment and chemicals they need. Are you concerned about that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (42:59);Thank you very much. We rule nothing out in terms of further social distancing if that is needed or further enforcement of social distancing. However, the British public are, in a very large part, following the new rules, and the police are policing them largely with their normal consent-based attitude and approach. I pay tribute to the police because bringing in a new set of rules like this in short order does, of course, provide a challenge to the police, and I think that they have risen to that challenge."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (43:41);On the second question of the testing, we’re absolutely determined to hit the new goal of 100,000 a tests a day under all five pillars of the testing strategy that I set out. Yes, that will involve some challenges. There’s no doubt, including making sure we get hold of all of the parts, for instance, and all of the reagents."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (44:06);Everybody can see that there are challenges around the world in terms of increasing testing, but we’re determined that we’re going to get there, and this is going to have to be a national effort in which not only my team and the people at Public Health England and across the NHS, but the whole life sciences industry is going to have to play a part."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (44:27);I’ve been really delighted by the response since I set that challenge down at this press conference yesterday, and more people have come forward saying that they can turn their capabilities to increasing testing. We’re going to have to hit that target. JVT, I don’t know whether you want to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jonathan Van-Tam: (44:47);No, Secretary of State. I think you’ve answered the question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (44:50);Have you got any follow-up, Dan? Is that okay?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Dan Martin: (44:53);That’s fine. Thanks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (44:54);Okay, good stuff. Martin Bagot from The Mirror. Hello."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Martin Bagot: (44:59);Hi, good afternoon. Secretary of State, at yesterday’s briefing when you promised 100,000 daily tests by the end of the month, you seemed to acknowledge only 25,000 of these were likely to be the more urgent in need antigen test, which can tell if a patient currently has the virus. The Prime Minister promised 25,000 daily antigen tests last month, and now delivering on this appears to have been delayed until the end of April. Can you acknowledge today that we expect the peak to come in the next fortnight and Germany is increasing the antigen tests from 70,000 a day? Do you think this could come too little, too late?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Martin Bagot: (45:33);Secondly, could we have some clarification on the national lockdown guidance on the eve of what looks like being a sunny weekend? Given many families don’t have access to a garden, can people spend time in green spaces, for example, having a picnic for an hour, so long as they are in household groups? Or is it just a case of jog or walk for an hour and then go home?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (45:52);All right. Thanks very much, Martin. Just on the first one, I want to be crystal clear that the goal that I set yesterday was 100,000 tests per day over all five pillars of the testing strategy. Pillar one, which has brought us to 10,000 tests per day, that is set and was always set to get to 25,000 by the end of April. But pillar two, which is bringing in the private companies to also deliver, that is part of the goal, as is pillar three, which is the antigen test to see whether you have the virus, pillar four, which is the research, and pillar five, which is the national effort to bring companies that haven’t hitherto been involved in testing into this great challenge."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (46:42);So we, in fact, increased the goal for the end of April from about 25,000 to 100,000. Then we will go on to meet the target that the Prime Minister has previously set out of eventually 250,000 tests a day. It was all, as I set out yesterday, answering that specific question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (47:10);On the question about what people should do over the weekend, it is incredibly important that people follow the guidelines. I know that it’s going to be sunny, and it may be tempting, but it’s staying at home that saves lives, and I think we should just be absolutely crystal clear about that. The guidelines have been set out in terms of people going out for exercise reasons either on their own or with people in their household. People need to stick to the guidelines, and we’re going to stick with those guidelines. Thanks very much, Martin. Jen Williams from the Manchester Evening News. Hi, Jen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jen Williams: (47:50);All right. Thank you. A couple of questions for the Health Secretary from me. We’re getting reports here and there’ve been reports elsewhere as well of care homes being told that their residents may not be admitted to hospital if they have suspected coronavirus. There have already been cases where a significant number of people in a single care home have died including [inaudible 00:00:48:08]. Is there a blanket policy across the system not to admit care home residents into hospital?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jen Williams: (48:14);Secondly, also on social care, there are growing concerns with insufficient PPE and testing for infection as a whole. Counselors are now having to source their own, but are finding that they’re facing escalating prices. There are fears more broadly that sufficient care has not been prioritized at the national level. So is social care an afterthought in this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jen Williams: (48:33);Just finally, on PPE as a whole, how many units do we have in the national stockpile, and how many are we expected to need during the course of the outbreak?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (48:43);Okay. Thank you very much indeed for those three questions. The first one on care homes, it is absolutely not a blanket rule that people shouldn’t go to hospital from care homes. Hospital is there for people when they need it and when the doctors advise that they go. We have 2,029 spare critical care beds in the NHS right now, 2,029. That is before we bring on stream the Nightingale hospitals, and that is testament to the NHS who have done amazing work. They’ve already expanded the number of critical care beds by two and a half thousand for COVID-19 patients."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (49:31);So there is capacity in the hospitals right now to deal with COVID-19, and there is no blanket rule. It is a clinical judgment about when somebody goes to hospital. I don’t know if Ruth might want to add something on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (49:47);On the PPE question we have millions of pieces of PPE in the stockpile, and I can make sure that we get the exact figure to you. I haven’t got it on me, but we are also replenishing it all the time. Because whilst we have a very large stockpile, we are also using it. So we’ve got to make sure that we replenish it, and we’re replenishing it both from buying internationally, where much of it traditionally, has been made and also making it domestically."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (50:23);I’ll give a shout out to Burberry who’ve turned over their production to the production of gowns to add to the stockpile and to get PPE to people who need it, which is another part of the national effort. I think Burberry deserve the credit for what they’ve done so far for the nation and hopefully lots more Burberry gowns to come. Ruth, I don’t know if you want to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Ruth May: (50:48);Two points. Thank you very much, Secretary of State. So about the care homes, my mother-in-law, Millie, lives in a care home, and that is her home. So clinicians from whatever background will make a decision based on the clinical need of that person as to whether they need hospital care because that’s the important part. With regard to social care, I know that out of the 6,000 nurses that are coming back onto our emergency register, some of those are opting to go into social care. I am delighted to see that we’re offering people the option of coming into our hospitals, coming into our primary care setting but also into social care, and I’m going to be woefully sure that we continue to do that over the next few weeks too."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (51:35);Okay. Does that answer the question, Jen?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Jen Williams: (51:35);Yeah, it does. But on the PPE, I mean, obviously you said you’d come back on the numbers in terms of how many you’ve got in the stockpile. But do you know how many you’re going to need over the course of the pandemic?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (51:45);Well, it depends how long the pandemic lasts. But at the moment we are distributing many millions of pieces every day. In the last 24 hours it was 26 million. Over the last couple of weeks it’s around 400 million. So you can see that we’re getting through it fast, and so we’re replenishing it at the other end as fast as we can. But the challenge in PPE is a challenge of distribution rather than a challenge of having the stock."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (52:15);I also didn’t answer your question about social care with PPE because it’s incredibly important to me that we get the protective equipment that we need to people working in social care as well as in the NHS and all parts of the NHS. The new PPE guidance that we set out yesterday, which has got very broad support, that sets out what sort of PPE is appropriate in what sort of setting, and we will deliver that PPE into social care."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (52:49);I know that it’s a challenge not least because there’s around 26,000 social care settings, a combination of care homes and organizations that provide care in people’s homes, and so it is more complicated than delivering to the NHS. But the priority of getting the right PPE to social care is exactly the same as the priority of getting the right PPE to the NHS, and that’s what the system, with the support of the military, is doing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-3","Matt Hancock: (53:16);Thank you very much indeed. I think that’s all we’ve got time for today, but no doubt there’ll be more to come in these daily press conferences. I am very grateful to all of the questions, and I’m very grateful to both Jonathan Van-Tam and Ruth May for answering the questions with me. Thanks very much indeed."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","British officials gave their daily coronavirus briefing on April 5, led by Matt Hancock and Jenny Harries. Read the full transcript here"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Alex Thomson: (00:08);What exactly does that mean? So if people continued to ignore your social distancing rule, what does tightening up the measures actually in practical terms mean?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (00:17);Well, we’re not planning any changes to those rules imminently, but we do absolutely require people to follow them. And we have had these questions about the boundaries of the rules and people pushing the boundaries. But as Jenny just set out, there’s very clear reasons that we set the rules as they are and we want people to follow those rules. And of course there’s now the police enforce against them. They’re not rules that anybody would want to have in place, but they’re rules that need to be in place and everybody must follow them and stay at home wherever possible unless for those four reasons. And we’re crystal clear about that. And we’ve set those rules, we’re enforcing against those rules and we reiterate those rules because that is the best way to be able to bend the curve down and stop the spread of the virus. Alex Thomson from Channel 4."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Alex Thomson: (01:18);Well, good afternoon to you both. You’ll both be aware that in the last few hours an urgent directive has gone out to NHS ICU doctors to the effect that if hospitals are using a lot of oxygen machines, the entire oxygen supplied to the hospital can fail from C-PAP face mask ventilators right through to operating theaters. So what has been done to address that critical problem and more widely, we understand three hospitals in the past few days have come close and these are running out of oxygen. What’s being done to increase supplies to ensure that doesn’t happen in the coming days and weeks when clearly the number of patients will increase?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (02:00);Yes, this is a very important operational question. We have adequate supplies of the oxygen that’s needed in hospitals. We need to of course, make sure that each hospital has that available. We have had an equipment failure as I think you referenced and we therefore had to divert some ambulances, but this is the normal operation of the NHS when there are things like equipment failures. Of course interest in it is heightened because of the nature of coronavirus but the supply, the quantity of oxygen and supply of oxygen is something that we’ve been working very hard on and we have a very high degree of confidence in the supply of oxygen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (02:45);So I was just going to add actually some comments that I think Professor Steve Paris made a few days ago, which is actually to signal that this is a positive sign in most cases. If you have a whole system where it’s unusual in the UK where we have a national health service, it means that we have a system of flagging where there are potential risks or problems before they actually become a significant problem. It is a strength of our system that we have these flags going off at regular intervals. And I think his comment back to the questions at the time was, “This is a positive thing. We flag them, we deal with them as they arise.” But to reinforce what the secretary state has said is there is no insufficiency of oxygen and I think the public should not be concerned that if they become ill and need a hospital admission, that care is available to them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (03:37);Okay, great. Charlotte Ivers from talkRADIO."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Charlotte Ivers: (03:41);Thank you Mr. Hancock. You changed and updated the rules on PPE a few days ago and I was being to a doctor who said before these changes, he was moving between treating COVID patients and cancer patients who were… had compromised immune systems and he was terrified that he would be deadly to them because he didn’t feel it was adequate. So can I ask you firstly, was he correct to be scared and if he wasn’t correct to be scared, why has something had to change?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (04:11);Well, we’ve changed the upgraded the guidance. So now in all instances it’s at or above the levels of protective equipment recommended by the World Health Organization. But we’ve also upgraded it following more being known about the virus. As we learned about the science of coronavirus over the last few months. So we will keep upgrading and improving guidance as we learn more about it. So that was the main reason for the changes to make sure that we reflected the latest that we know about the virus and I think that the new guidance set out on Thursday has been very widely welcomed and provides clarity about what protective equipment is needed in which circumstance. And then of course we have to deliver and make sure that that protective equipment that is needed according to the guidance gets to the frontline. Jenny?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (05:14);Yeah. So I think just to support that, I don’t know the individual case that you are describing, but clearly it wouldn’t matter whether you were a cancer patient or a patient in another setting. We want to maintain good infection prevention control procedures and the bedrock of that in the UK and throughout the NHS is actually systematic practice. It’s one reason why this country is very good. We don’t get a lot of nosocomial infection as an onward spread in healthcare settings because it is the basics, which we are also obviously been teaching the public around a good hand and respiratory hygiene in a systematic approach and using PPE carefully, which keeps that at bay. But I think the new guidance there, what it has done is it’s reinforced the fact that our guidance previously was actually inconsistent with WHO guidance. It was endorsed, it was a report, I think back on the 27th by WHO and recognized."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (06:11);But what we’re seeing now is a slightly different prevalence of disease and we’ve adapted our guidance to manage that. So there’s a level of uncertainty and there’s a level of protection which is higher in some high-risk procedures. So the areas we’re very concerned about from a clinical perspective are what we call aerosol generating procedures under pressure. So this is where somebody, where you get a potential airborne spread and we want to make sure people have absolutely adequate protection there. And then the other issue is recognizing the settings in which people are working. So the most obvious one would be if we went back say four months, very unlikely anybody in the emergency department would see anybody with COVID-19. Actually now in some of those settings where it’s uncertain for professionals in when they’re first seeing patients and understanding them, it’s important that they have COVID in anticipation of what might be a different prevalence of disease. So that’s basically, I can give you more detail of the actual equipment, but that’s as effectively what we’re trying to do is covering the changing circumstances."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (07:22);Did you have a follow-up? You put your hand up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Charlotte Ivers: (07:25);Yes. I was just going to ask you talks about us now knowing more about the disease. So knowing what we know now, should we have had these higher levels of protection from the beginning? Were people at risk?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (07:36);Well the thing is that you can only make decisions based on the information that you have at the time. And we’re constantly looking for new information about this disease so that we can improve the guidance that we have and the response that we have to it. The question that we have in government and that I ask myself every day is, are we doing the right thing now and what can we change to improve our response for the future? And so you can have a debate about the past but you have to take decisions on the information that’s available at the time. And I think the previous guidance was the best guidance possible on the information that was available at the time. And then we’ve upgraded it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (08:22);So I think to support that, it’s not so much we are obviously learning all the time about the disease, but the basic guidance was entirely appropriate and as I say, endorsed by WHO despite I think some media reporting about differences. But the important thing is we are now operating in a slightly different environment. So it’s the uncertainty that some clinicians, not all clinicians find themselves in that we have reviewed where that is to ensure that they feel safer in those environments."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (08:52);I think there are other opportunities we’re learning from. So for example, where we are finding that you can reuse masks safely, for example, with appropriate cleaning and technology. That’s very helpful because of course we need to keep in mind that regardless of supplies and advice, the whole world wants personal protective equipment and it’s really important that we all use it appropriately and judiciously, exactly have it in the right places where it’s needed but not be wasting it so that the people who are working on the front line, whether it be in care homes, domiciliary care, or in the front line of an emergency department, they have the right PPE at the right time for the right clinical risk and that’s what our whole basis of the guidance is based upon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (09:41);Thanks very much Jane Merrick at the i."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane Merrick: (09:46);Thank you. How do you square what the queen says today about the nation’s attributes of self-discipline with your warning about having to toughen the restrictions of people, don’t stop gathering and parks? That’s to the health secretary and to the chief, the deputy chief medical officer. What is the testing strategy for care homes and prisons given that these are emerging as a major hotspots for cases and sadly deaths? Are prisons and care homes going to be next in line for mass testing after NHS workers?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (10:15);Well, I think we’re all looking forward to seeing what the queen has to say and watching her address and listening very carefully to it. I think the message from all of those of us in it across the board is very clear, which is that we need perseverance in the face of some great challenges and that also means the perseverance in following the rules. And I couldn’t be clearer about my emphatic requirement of people, which is backed up by law to follow the rules that we’ve set out and to make sure that people stay at home. That is the number one thing that you can do. And we’ve set out those four exemptions and people should stay at home unless they’re going out for one of those four reasons and those four reasons alone. Jenny."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (11:10);Thank you. So absolutely. You’ve highlighted two very critical and domains if you like, for public health surveillance and intervention. That’s been recognized right from the start of this incident and in fact is recognized before COVID-19. We always keep a close eye on care homes and prisons because the setting in which people live is potentially problematic. So the care homes, clearly you tend to have a collection in the nicest possible use of the word of potentially elderly or more vulnerable individuals. That’s one issue. And then certainly in prisons you are intentionally through a prison operation holding people together. So both of those environments are very well recognized. In fact, Public Health England hosts the WHO Collaborating Centre for healthy prisons. So we have a lot of experience and actually advise other parts of the world. And I know that the key consultants there have been working with ministry of justice and with the prime minister on establishing and looking at what have those environments should be treated."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (12:19);You asked specifically about testing and testing in both prisons and care homes has always been on the priority list. So once we moved from containment to delay, if you remember the categories of testing that we have our clinical care of patients in hospitals as an absolute category because that’s how we manage the safety and the benefit of that health intervention, but what we then do is test in care homes and prisons. What we do do though is we wouldn’t necessarily test everybody because you want to test whether it’s going to be a positive advantage to doing the testing. I’ll stop in a moment and we usually test up to about five people to establish… It can vary depending on the setting but to be sure that we have established what the issue is. It’s usually quite possible in a setting like that to understand then on a clinical basis whether there is a case, it may not be laboratory confirmed but it would be a presumed clinical case."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jim: (13:22);Thanks very much. Jim at the FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane Merrick: (13:25);Sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (13:25);Oh sorry. You wanted to come back Jane, sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane Merrick: (13:28);Wanted to come back on the question on testing that you said that they are next in line, but when will that testing take place? Given that there are probably lots of people who are very concerned about their relatives and care homes and also the people who work in care homes and people who work in prisons."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (13:42);Yeah, so sorry to perhaps I didn’t explain myself clearly enough. So for any care home outbreaks, whether it relates to a worker or an individual resident or a prisoner or somebody supporting him or her, those tests happen now they are in the prioritized list already. So the groups of people who are routinely tested and have been ever since we have started responding to this incident include potential outbreaks in care homes and prisons. That’s been going on right from the start. In terms of other workers there as we go forward for NHS workers and front-line care workers and responders, clearly those are in the priority group because we recognize that those workers, we need to think of the care sector almost like the other arm. We talk a lot about the acute hospital sector, but we often forget that it’s the care sector who are operating in the community, community nurses and domiciliary care workers who are equally important in our drive to manage this incident. So they will come within prioritized key workers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (14:49);Does that answer the question Jane?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane Merrick: (14:54);I think it was just to get clarity on when that testing would take place for those workers. If there’s no specific timing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (15:00);So the outbreaks happen already and the other workers will be falling into the expanding program which has been ramping up as you’ve heard and I think has been reported on a daily basis this week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (15:12);Thanks Jim from the FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jim: (15:17);Secretary of state could you please tell us yes or no, whether the government is preparing to take equity stakes on taxpayer’s behalf and some of the large companies which have found themselves in major crisis because of the pandemic. And if so, do you think that Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic is a worthy recipient of that kind of assistance given that in 2017 Virgin Care sued your beloved NHS after losing the contracts and given that, so Richard lives as a tax exile on Necker Island. And the question for Jenny Harris, I know you might say it’s too early to speculate about how the lockdown might end. The new focus seems to suggest this morning that there could be a kind of staggered way of doing it in terms of different age groups and different regions coming out to the lockdown before others. Is that-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jim: (16:03);… and different regions coming out of the lockdown before others. Is that possible?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (16:05);Well, I’m going to not answer the first question and then Jenny can answer the second one. My response to the first question is this is an area in which Rishi Sunak has been doing unbelievable work. He’s recognized around the world for the first class economic response that we’ve got here in the UK. And overall, from the protection of workers, the protection of self employed right across the board they’ve taken the right steps and I think done it with remarkable speed. Of course there’s enormous economic consequences for businesses of all sectors. Of the decisions that we’ve had to take. And no, these decisions on social distancing aren’t the sorts of decisions anybody would want to take."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (16:54);But, I think the way that the prime minister and chancellor have responded on the economic front has been absolutely first rate and I’ll leave it to them to answer questions about the details of what might or might not happen. Which their best place to do rather than me. Jenny on the second point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Dr. Jenny Harries: (17:14);Thank you, yes. I think the brief answer is all things are possible. It’s important because right from the start, we’ve driven the response from science and we have modeled. Neil clearly has been one of the key contributors to that modeling group and in us understanding what interventions we need to put in at what time. I know there’s a huge amount of work ongoing at the moment looking at both the individual packets of intervention that have gone in. So we’ve staggered them in. Some of them had significantly more impact on the way in and those are the ones that we put in at the time to give the maximum benefit."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Dr. Jenny Harries: (17:54);But clearly what we don’t yet know, and I think this is critical. I didn’t hear Neil’s interview this morning, I apologize. But what we don’t yet know is how the disease on a whole population basis has affected our immunity, how many of us have had it and how many haven’t. And that is important. If we can find that information because it will give us an understanding then, as he has obviously described, by region for example. So London has had a lot of cases here. If it was found that a large number of people would immune them, it may be that different interventions could come off sooner or later."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Dr. Jenny Harries: (18:35);Equally, if we find that there are areas where there have been less cases prevalent, then we need to be very mindful what would happen if the social interaction levels increased in those particular areas, and what the impact might be. As you will have heard many people say before, the very last thing we want to do is have put in all of this effort with everybody trying to do the right thing, almost everybody, across the country, and then find we lift the lid too early and we have a second spike. It will waste the effort that we’ve put in and we still need to get over that very first hump really of the epidemic curve, and then look at detail. But I can assure you, there is a huge amount of work involved in that and Neil clearly has contributing to it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (19:23);Thanks Jim. The next question from Harriet at the PA. Hi."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Harriet: (19:30);Hi, to the [inaudible 00:19:31] first, many people here have spent the last couple of weeks obeying [inaudible 00:19:34] and socially distancing themselves. We’re wondering if it’s safe for them to see family if they’ve also been following the guidance over the Easter weekend. Are they safe to do that? And if not, can you explain why not given that surely the chances of them having Corona virus are now very small?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Harriet: (19:51);And to Dr. Harrie, as we know that the testing isn’t showing the true picture of the current spread of the virus. How many people do you estimate have had or currently have the Corona virus in the UK?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (20:03);Well thanks Harriet. The answer to the first question is really clear which is that this virus can spread in all sorts of different ways. Both from directly respiratory and also through objects and through touching objects that others then touch. The uncertainty over who has it, especially before they have symptoms, means that the only effective way of bending the curve down is to reduce that social contact. And that’s why we came to the conclusions that we did, the difficult conclusions, that we have to have such extraordinary social distancing policies in place. And why we took the decision more than a week ago now to flip the basis of those rules from saying you can’t do certain things to saying you must stay at home unless you’re doing one of a small number of things, four things. Which we’ve been absolutely crystal clear about those rules and the evidence shows that a very high proportion of the public understand those rules and a very high proportion of the public are following those rules. We need everybody to be following those rules. And that’s why we talk about them so much and the importance of following them. On the other question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Dr. Jenny Harries: (21:30);So I might just add to the Secretary of State’s comments actually on that. Because I think sometimes people get slightly confu-… Their inter mixing if you like the phrase family with household. That’s quite an important difference. So in infection control or public health terms, it is a household which is really important. So for example, if you’re a group of students and you probably will be home with your family in one household now. But previously you might have had five students living in a flat. Under one roof, sharing cooking, bathrooms, all sorts of things. That in infection control terms is a household. So the important thing here is we know that households tend to have the same risk exposures. So they tend to have the same opportunity to become infected from one another. And it’s one of the reasons why we have the stay at home family isolation policy. It’s a household isolation policy."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Dr. Jenny Harries: (22:27);So if your family is with you, the likelihood that one of you have had it, particularly after you’ve all waited 14 days, then probably your risk is low. It’s possible that one of you may have had it, not noticed any symptoms particularly. But if your family lives in a different town, they are an entirely different household. And mixing those two is not what we want to do generally. So I think the difference between family and household. So it’s stay with the people that you live under the same roof with and keep doing that for as long as you can and safely. So that really just answered to that from an infection control perspective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Dr. Jenny Harries: (23:07);And I can’t answer your second question and I’m not going to try. Because that is exactly why we need to understand the immune picture across the population. Obviously some countries are a bit ahead of us. So somewhere like China, other countries, we learn where we can from reports that they do and we’re looking. But there is no country in the world currently which has good population based serology testing for immunity to be able to say with confidence how many of the population have had the disease and which layers. Which ages, which sexes or which people with different characteristics. We just need to understand that in the future. So I won’t hesitate a guess at this point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (23:56);Does that answer your question, Harriet? Or at least explain why we’re not able to answer it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Harriet: (24:01);Yeah, just to clarify so people who have only been going to the shops or only going out for exerciser are still at risk of having Corona virus, having picked it up and those sorts of things you’re saying. And therefor aren’t safe to travel even by car and see family or friends."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (24:16);That’s right. I have a particular interest in this having had Corona virus and having come through it. Obviously I’ve asked all these questions for myself and as well as Secretary of State. The rules are there for a reason, even for those of us who’ve had it. Where the science predicts it’s likely that our immunity is higher and our ability to transmit the virus is lower, we are not yet confident enough in how much higher the immunity is and how much lower the likelihood of those of us who’ve had the disease transmitting it is, to be able to change the rules. So there is clarity on the social distancing rules for people whether they’ve had Corona virus or not. And the rules are the same for everyone and will be until the science an give us confidence that we can say something different to those who have been through it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (25:18);Final question. Paris from the Scotsman."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Paris: (25:22);Thank you Secretary of State. In the past few hours we’ve learned that the chief medical officer of Scotland, Dr. Catherine Calderwood for the past two weekends has driven over 40 miles to a holiday home taking with her on one occasion, her entire family and on the other occasion her husband. How damaging is that to your efforts to convince the public to stay home and save lives? If Dr. Calderwood worked for you Mr. Hancock, would you have asked her for her resignation?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Paris: (25:50);And can I ask Dr. Harries, is she still an effective spokes person for the public information campaign and do you have a second home that you’ve visited since movement restrictions came into place?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (26:03);Well thanks very much, Paris. This is a matter for the Scottish government. They I know are addressing the questions that have been asked in Scotland. These rules are there for everyone. We couldn’t be clearer the social distancing rules are there for everyone to follow. I understand that the Scottish CMO has apologized and as far as I see it, that is a matter for the Scottish government to address. Thanks very much everybody. That is it for today. I hope that you, like me, will tune in to see the address from Her Majesty at 8:00 this evening. Thank you all very much indeed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (26:55);(silence)"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (30:24);Good afternoon and welcome back to Downing Street for today’s Corona virus press conference. I’m joined today by our deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jenny Harries. The government is working through out action plan which aims to save as many lives as possible by slowing the spread of the virus. Protecting the NHS and preventing it from being overwhelmed. Our response is built upon the bedrock of the best possible scientific and medical advice so that we can take the right steps at the right time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (31:01);First by slowing the spread of the virus across our society. And second, by boosting the capacity of the NHS so that we can always care for those who’ve fall sick. Sadly Corona virus continues to spread. I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program according to the latest figures, 195,524 people have now been tested for the virus. And 47,806 have been tested positive. Across the UK the number of people admitted to hospital with Corona virus symptoms is now at 16,702. And of those who’ve contracted the virus, 4,934 have sadly died. We mourn their passing and we offer our profound sympathy."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (32:03);We mourn their passing, and we offer our profound sympathies to their families and friends. I’ve lost two people that I was fond of, so I understand what a difficult time this is for the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (32:15);This evening, Her Majesty the Queen will give a rare formal address to the nation. I know that we’ll all be watching and listening to see and hear what she has to say on behalf of us all. I understand that people are yearning to know how long this will all last, and the answer is entirely dependent on how much people follow the rules on social distancing. Following these rules is mission critical if we’re to protect the NHS, slow the spread, and give the NHS time to expand capacity, and so to save lives. The more people follow the rules, then the faster we will all be through it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (33:04);So I say this to the small minority of people who are breaking the rules or pushing the boundaries. You’re risking your own life and the lives of others, and you’re making it harder for us all."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (33:18);We’ve included exercise as one of the things that you can leave your house to do, because exercise is good for our physical and our mental health, but please do not bend or break this rule. We can’t rule out further steps, but I don’t want anyone to think that any changes to the social distancing rules are imminent, because the vast majority are following the rules."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (33:45);To you, to all those at home, to all those who are following the rules, I want to say thank you on behalf of us all and especially on behalf of the doctors, nurses, and other colleagues who put their lives on the line to care for you in the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (34:02);As well as working to slow the spread, of course, we are increasing the capacity of the NHS. Last week, we saw the completion of the Nightingale Hospital in East London. It was planned and constructed and fully staffed within nine days. It was humbling to see the NHS, the military, and everyone involved in its construction pulling together in this time of need. There are many more Nightingales to come across our entire United Kingdom, including Harrogate, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast, and Cardiff. These new hospitals are on top of the expansion in critical care across the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (34:38);There are currently over 2,336 spare critical care beds for the NHS in England and over 9,000 ventilators are now available to NHS coronavirus patients across the country thanks to the national effort to ramp up capacity. 300 new ventilators arrived this weekend from China, and we’ve seen UK manufacturers working at pace to develop new ones."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (35:05);Of course, hospitals and ventilators are critical, but our NHS is nothing without the people who work there. It’s been so encouraging to see over 27,000 former healthcare professionals signing up to return to the NHS frontline. I want to say a great big thank you to each and every one of you. Welcome back, and I hope that many more will sign up in the weeks ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (35:33);This weekend, we also have launched our latest technology, a new coronavirus status checker. It asks people who currently have coronavirus symptoms to share their experiences to help us in our fight against the virus. It’ll help make use of this information, which will in turn help us to understand the disease, so we can, for instance, allocate resources like oxygen and ventilators and additional staff to where they’re needed most. Please do your bit if you currently have symptoms by going to www.nhs.uk/statuschecker. Because the more people who use it, then the better informed our response will be. The smart use of data like this and digital technologies is one of the strongest bulwarks that we have against coronavirus, because new technologies can help us to meet these new threats and allow us to gain the understanding and the insight that we need to defeat this virus once and for all."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (36:35);Technology is one piece of the jigsaw and an important piece, but ultimately, the strongest weapon in our arsenal is if we join together in tough times and follow the rules that have been put in place. I, like many of you, have young children at home. So I know what a challenge this can be for families. I really understand how much everyone wants to enjoy the sunny weather, but the cruel thing about coronavirus is that it thrives on social contact and the human bonds that brings so much to life."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (37:10);So we must show our resolve. All the things that we miss right now, going to the pub for a pint with friends or sitting in the park with a book or hugging a grandchild, we will have these moments again, and they’ll mean even more to us. But until then, the only way to protect yourselves, your loved ones, and your community is to stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (37:39);I’ll now handover to Jenny to take us through the daily statistics charts."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (37:43);Thank you,. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (37:44);Could I have the first slide please? So what we have here, I think we’ve just got four slides to show what’s happening over the last few days. I think it’s really important that people can see the data and what is happening from our interventions. The first slide probably hasn’t changed very much, but that is really good news. What it shows is that our transport use is down and remains down since early March, beginning back in February as well. We’re managing to sustain that. As the Secretary of State has said, it is really important that we continue to do that despite the good weather. So thank you to the members of the public for observing that and please ensure that we keep moving in that direction. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (38:32);So the second slide shows the number of new cases. Now, these are lab test reported cases. You’ll be aware that our capacity is increasing all the time on laboratory tests. So we need to interpret this with a little bit of caution. We are following to a degree an epidemic curve. We can see the rise, and we will of course in due course be looking to see that level off. But you will notice that over the last 24 hours or so, there is an apparent big surge there. We just need to keep in mind that we need to watch this for a trend over time, because as our testing capacity increases, inevitably we will find more cases. Thank you. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (39:18);Again, England hospital admissions for COVID-19. I think the critical thing here is, again, looking at the data as it flows across. Think of the trend across the points on the graph, not on an individual day-to-day basis. But nevertheless, it gives an indication of how hard our different parts of the country are working. Here it’s hospital admissions, so it’s the NHS. But there will be comparative streams of health and care staff working in the care sector as well as the number of cases rise. So clearly London, we all know, has been working super-hard on the front line, and those cases continue to rise now with an increase over the last 24 hours in the northwest."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (40:05);We still, as the Secretary of State has said, have capacity in all of our hospitals to manage these cases, and we’re hoping in due course if everybody continues to practice social distancing, that those cases will start to fall. Clearly, there is a delay in the number of hospital admissions from when people often contract the disease and then become more ill and need more intensive care. So there will be a lag on some of this data compared with our social distancing measures. The last slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (40:40);Again, this gives an indication of the global death comparison. Now again, as many of my colleagues have said before, this tries to give a direct comparison, even though some of the international comparative data is difficult to interpret. But I think it’s important that we continue to look and where necessary and where possible to learn from other countries. The UK in this slide is in blue in the center of that grouping. These are the deaths which have all been calculated from a zero day. They’ve been brought back to when the first 50 deaths were reported in the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (41:21);Now for the UK, these are COVID-associated deaths. They are all sad events. They will not all be a death as a result of COVID, but certainly we need to be sure that we are counting everything appropriately and being very clear and transparent on that. So we will continue to track and monitor this and learn from other countries where we can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (41:45);Thanks very much. If we now go to questions. First question, Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Hugh Pym: (41:51);Thank you very much. Secretary of State, you’ve said there are just over 9,000 ventilators in the system, and in due course, 18, 000 should be in place. How many will there be there next week at a time when experts say the NHS will be close to or at the peak of demand?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (42:11);Thanks, Hugh. As I said, we have over 9,000 ventilators now across the NHS, and we are ramping that up. The production from the domestic manufacturer is starting to come on stream, and the key goal is to always keep the amount of critical care beds, which nearly all need ventilators, above the demand. I haven’t got an exact figure for how many extra we will deliver next week, not least because when we bring them in from abroad, there are risks to the timing there and challenges to the timing. But I would expect many more over the next week. The goal continues to be to keep ramping it up to the 18,000 target that we’ve set. We don’t expect on the central expectation to need 18,000, but I want to keep the ramp up going, because I always want to keep the supply ahead of the need. So I’m sorry I don’t have any more detail than that which we’ve put out today, but that is because of the inherently uncertain dates of arrival of kit, especially from our international sources."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (43:34);Shehab Khan from ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Shehab Khan: (43:37);Health Secretary, there will be plenty of people, some of whom have no access to open spaces who do not understand why they cannot briefly sit in a park if they listen to the government’s guidance and stay two meters away from the nearest person. Can you explain exactly why you shouldn’t be doing that? Also, if I may, you just said you are not ruling out further measures if people ignore the social distancing measures. Can you clarify with practical examples what exactly you are considering and in what circumstances they’ll be used?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (44:09);No, we’re not planning any changes to the rules imminently, so we’re not looking at any specifics in that space. But what we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed. Of course, I understand why people ask the question of why have the rules been set as they have. The reason is that exercise helps your physical health, your mental health, is incredibly important. That’s why we’ve kept it in the rules and the reason that sitting and not exercising doesn’t give you the advantage that exercise does. I don’t know whether from a medical point of view, Jenny, you want to say anything more in addition to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (44:57);Really just to add to that, I think we have always said right from the start of managing this incident that it’s really important that we balance physical and mental health needs as the Secretary of State has described. But I think one of the issues, and we’ve taken that into account through scientific advice, is around behaviors as well. It’s not just the what are you doing, it’s the how that you do it. So if you’re sitting on a park bench, people tend to accumulate. It’s very difficult to prevent that. I think actually having rules where we are getting all of the benefits and minimizing the risks of the harms is an important approach to maintain."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (45:39);Thanks very much. Does that answer your question? Would you like a …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Shehab Khan: (45:44);Yeah. You mentioned that you were considering tightening up the measures. What exactly does that mean? So if people continued to ignore your social distancing rule, what does tightening up the measures actually in practical terms mean?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (45:58);Well, we’re not planning any changes to those rules imminently, but we do absolutely require people to follow them. We have had these questions about the boundaries of the rules and people pushing the boundaries. But as Jenny just set out, there’s very clear reasons that we set the rules as they are, and we want people to follow those rules. Of course, there’s now the police in force against them. They’re not rules that anybody would want to have in place, but they’re rules that need to be in place, and everybody must follow them and stay at home wherever possible unless for those four reasons. We’re crystal clear about that. We’ve set those rules, we’re enforcing against those rules, and we reiterate those rules, because that is best way to be able to bend the curve down and stop the spread of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (46:57);Alex Thomson from Channel four."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Alex Thomson: (47:00);Good afternoon to you both. You’ll both be aware that in the last few hours, an urgent directive has gone out to NHS ICU doctors to the effect that if hospitals are using a lot of oxygen machines, the entire oxygen supply to the hospital can fail, from C-PAP face mask ventilators right through to operating theaters. So what has been done to address that critical problem? More widely, we understand three hospitals in the past few days have come close indeed to running out of oxygen. What’s being done to increase supplies to ensure that doesn’t happen in the coming days and weeks, when clearly the number of patients will increase?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (47:40);Yes, this is a very important operational question. We have adequate supplies of the oxygen that’s needed in hospitals. We need to, of course, make sure that each hospital has that available. We have had an equipment failure, as I think you referenced. We therefore had to divert some ambulances, but this is the normal-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (48:03);He therefore had to divert some ambulances, but this is the normal operation of the NHS when there are things like equipment failures. Of course, interest in it is heightened because of the nature of coronavirus, but the supply, the quantity of oxygen and supply of oxygen is something that we’ve been working very hard on and we have a very high degree of confidence in the supply of oxygen. Is there anything else?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (48:26);I was just going to add actually some comments that I think Professor Steve Parris made a few days ago, which is actually to signal that this is a positive sign in most cases. If you have a whole system where, it’s unusual in the UK where we have a National Health Service, it means that we have a system of flagging where there are potential risks or problems before they actually become a significant problem. It is a strength of our system that we have these flags going off at regular intervals, and I think his comment back to the questions at the time was this is a positive thing. We flag them, we deal with them as they arise, and but to reinforce what the secretary state has said, is there is no insufficiency of oxygen and I think the public should not be concerned that if they become ill and need a hospital admission, that care is available to them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (49:17);Okay, great. Charlotte Ives from talk radio."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Charlotte I.: (49:21);Thank you Mr. Hancock. You changed and updated the rules on PPE a few days ago. And I was speaking to a doctor who said before these changes he was moving between treating COVID patients and cancer patients who had compromised immune systems and he was terrified that he would be deadly to them because he didn’t feel it was adequate. So can I ask you firstly, was he correct to be scared and if he wasn’t correct to be scared, why has something had to change?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (49:51);Well, we’ve changed the upgraded the guidance. So now in all instances it’s at or above the levels of protective equipment recommended by the World Health Organization. But we’ve also upgraded it following more, being known about the virus. As we’ve learned about the science of coronavirus over the last few months. So we will keep upgrading and improving guidance as we learn more about it. So that was the main reason for the changes to make sure that we reflected the latest that we know about the virus. And I think that the new guidance set out on Thursday has been very widely welcomed and provides clarity about what protective equipment is needed, in which circumstance. And then of course we have to deliver and make sure that protective equipment that is needed according to the guidance gets to the frontline. Jenny."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (50:54);Yeah. So I think just to support that, I don’t know the individual case that you are describing, but clearly it wouldn’t matter whether you were a cancer patient or a patient in another setting. We want to maintain good infection prevention and control procedures. And the bedrock of that in the UK and throughout the NHS is actually systematic practice. It’s one reason why this country is very good. We don’t get a lot of nosocomial infection as an onward spread in healthcare settings because it is the basics, which we are also obviously been teaching the public around a good hand and respiratory hygiene in a systematic approach and using PP carefully, which keeps that at bay. But I think the new guidance there, what it has done is it’s reinforced the fact that our guidance previously was actually inconsistent with WHO guidance, it was endorsed, it was a, I think back on the 27th by WHO and recognized."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (51:51);But what we’re seeing now is a slightly different prevalence of disease and we’ve adapted our guidance to manage that. So there’s a level of uncertainty and there’s a level of protection which is higher in some high risk procedures. So the areas we’re very concerned about from a clinical perspective are what we call aerosol generating procedures under pressure. So this is where somebody, where you get a potential airborne spread and we want to make sure people have absolutely adequate protection there. And then the other issue is recognizing the settings in which people are working. So the most obvious one would be if we went back say four months, very unlikely anybody in the emergency department would see anybody with COVID-19. Actually now, in some of those settings where it’s uncertain for professionals when they’re first seeing patients and understanding them, it’s important that they have covered in anticipation of what might be a different prevalence of disease. So that’s basically, I can give you more detail of the actual equipment, but that’s as effectively what we’re trying to do is covering the changing circumstances."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (53:02);Did you have a follow up? You put your hand up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Charlotte I.: (53:06);Yes. I was just going to ask, you talked about us now knowing more about the disease. So knowing what we know now, should we have had these higher levels of protection from the beginning were people at risk?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (53:16);Well the thing is that you can only make decisions based on the information that you have at the time. And we’re constantly looking for new information about this disease so that we can improve the guidance that we have and the response that we have to it. So, the question that we have in government and that I ask myself every day is, are we doing the right thing now? And what can we change to improve our response for the future? And so you can have a debate about the past, but you have to take decisions on the information that’s available at the time. And I think the previous guidance was the best guidance possible on the information that was available at the time and then we’ve upgraded it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (54:03);So I think to support that, it’s not so much, we are obviously learning all the time about the disease, but the basic guidance was entirely appropriate. And as I say, endorsed by WHO, despite I think some media reporting about differences. But the important thing is we are now operating in a slightly different environment. So it’s the uncertainty that some clinicians, not all clinicians find themselves in that we have reviewed where that is to ensure that they feel safer in those environments."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (54:33);I think there are other opportunities we’re learning from. So for example, where we are finding that you can reuse masks safely, for example, with appropriate cleaning and technology. That’s very helpful because of course we need to keep in mind that regardless of supplies and advice, the whole world wants personal protective equipment and it’s really important that we all use it appropriately and judiciously. Exactly have it in the right places where it’s needed but not be wasting it so that the people who are working on the front line, whether it be in care homes, domiciliary care, or in the front line of an emergency department, they have the right PPE at the right time for the right clinical risk and that’s what our whole basis of the guidance is based upon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (55:21);Thanks very much. Jane Merrick at the i."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane M: (55:26);Thank you. How do you square what the Queen says today about the nation’s attributes of self discipline with your warning about having to toughen the restrictions of people, don’t stop gathering at parks? That’s to the health secretary and to the deputy chief medical officer. What is the testing strategy for care homes and prisons? Given that these are emerging as a major hotspots for cases and sadly deaths, are prisons and care homes going to be next in line for mass testing after NHS workers?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (55:56);Well, I think we’re all looking forward to seeing what the Queen has to say and watching her address and listening very carefully to it. I think the message from all of those of us in across the board is very clear, which is that we need perseverance in the face of some great challenges and that also means the perseverance in following the rules. And I couldn’t be clearer about my emphatic requirement of people, which is backed up by law to follow the rules that we’ve set out and to make sure that the people stay at home. That is the number one thing that you can do. And we’ve set out those four exemptions and people should stay at home unless they are going out for one of those four reasons and those four reasons alone. Jenny."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (56:50);Thank you. So, absolutely you’ve highlighted two very critical and domains if you like, for public health surveillance and intervention. That’s been recognized right from the start of this incident and in fact is recognized before COVID-19 we always keep a close eye on care homes in prisons because the setting in which people live is potentially problematic. So the care homes, clearly you tend to have a collection in the nicest possible use of the word of potentially elderly or more vulnerable individuals. That’s one issue. And then certainly in prisons you are intentionally through a prison operation holding people together. So both of those environments are very well recognized. In fact, Public Health England hosts the WHO collaborating center for healthy prisons. So we have a lot of experience and actually advise other parts of the world. And I know that the key consultants there have been working with Ministry of Justice and with the Prime Minister on establishing and looking at what have those environments should be treated. You are specifically about testing and testing in both prisons and care homes has always been on the priority list, so once we moved from containment to delay, if you remember the categories of testing that we have our clinical care of patients in hospitals as an absolute category because that’s how we manage the safety and the benefit of that health intervention. But what we then do is test in care homes and prisons. What we do do though is we wouldn’t necessarily test everybody because you want to test whether it’s going to be a positive advantage to doing the testing. I’ll stop in a moment, and we’ll usually test up to about five people to establish vary depending on the setting, but to be sure that we have established what the issue is. It’s usually quite possible in a setting like that to understand then on a clinical basis, whether there is a case, it may not be laboratory confirmed, but it would be a presumed clinical case."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (59:03);Thanks very much Jim at the FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane M: (59:05);Sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (59:06);Oh sorry. You wanted to come back Jane, sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane M: (59:08);Want to come back on the question on testing that you said that they are next in line, but when will that testing take place? Given that there are probably lots of people who are very concerned about their relatives in care homes and also the people who work in care homes and people who work in prisons."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (59:23);So sorry, perhaps didn’t explain myself clearly enough. So for any care home outbreaks, whether it relates to a worker or an individual resident or a prisoner or somebody supporting him or her, those tests happen now they are in the prioritized list already. So the groups of people who are routinely tested and have been ever since we have started responding to this incident include potential outbreaks in care homes and prisons. That’s been going on right from the start. In terms of other workers there as we go forward for NHS workers and front line care workers and responders, clearly those are in the priority group because we recognize that those workers, we need to think of the care sector almost like the other arm. We talk a lot about the acute hospital sector, but we often forget that it’s the care sector who are operating in the community, community nurses and domiciliary care workers who are equally important in our drive to to manage this incident so they will come within prioritize key workers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (01:00:30);Does that answer the question, Jane?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jane M: (01:00:34);I think it was just to get clarity on when that testing would take place for those workers. There’s no specific timing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jenny Harries: (01:00:41);The outbreaks happen already and the other workers will be falling into the expanding program, which has been ramping up as you’ve heard and I think has been reported on a daily basis this week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (01:00:53);Thanks. Jim from the FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Jim: (01:00:57);Secretary of State, could you please tell us yes or no, whether the government is preparing to take equity stakes of taxpayer’s behalf and some of the large companies which had found themselves in major crisis because of the pandemic and if so choosing that Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic is a worthy recipient of that kind of assistance given that in 2017 Virgin Care sued your beloved NHS after losing a contract. And given that, so Richard lives as a tax exile on Necker Island. And the question for Jenny Harries, I know you might say it’s too early to speculate about how the lockdown might end, but Neil Ferguson seemed to suggest this morning that there could be a kind of staggered way of doing it in terms of different age groups and different regions coming out of the lockdown before others. Is that possible?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-5","Matt Hancock: (01:01:46);Well, I’m going to not answer the first question and then Jenny can answer the second one. My response to the first question is, this is an area in which Rishi Sunak has been doing unbelievable work. He’s recognized around the world for the first class response, economic response that we’ve got here in the UK, and overall from the protection of workers, the protection of self employed right across the board. They’ve taken the right steps and I think done it with remark."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (00:00);… beat the coronavirus and see this nation through the challenge ahead. In the last week, under the Prime Minister’s leadership, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, has explained what we’re doing to boost manufacturing capability here at home to meet the rising demand for ventilators and other equipment in the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (00:21);Business Secretary Alok Sharma has been setting out what the government is doing to support small businesses. And yesterday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an update on what we’re doing to bolster capacity in the NHS, including increasing the number of critical care beds."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (00:38);The FCO is supporting all of these operational priorities, so we’re deployed the diplomatic network right around the world to source and buy ventilators and protective equipment so that we can reinforce the NHS frontline here at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (00:54);At the same time, we’re working with other governments and the airlines to bring home as many stranded British nationals as we possibly can, prioritizing our most vulnerable citizens. On commercial flights, we’ve helped over 200,000 UK nationals come home from Spain, 13,000 from Egypt, 8,000 from Indonesia. We’ve also chartered flights from seven different countries bringing home more than 2,000 British nationals. We’ve repatriated a further 1,550 from cruise ships, including most recently the Coral Princess and the Zandaam."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (01:33);And for those travelers who are still stuck abroad, we’re doing everything we can to keep international airports open, to keep commercial flights running, and to charter flights when there are no other options under the new arrangements that I announced last week, and which have now been agreed with 14 airlines. We’ve allocated 75 million pounds to support those arrangements."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (01:58);We’ve already had flights back from countries including Peru, Ghana, and Tunisia. And we’re fixing further flights from India, South Africa, Nepal, and the Philippines, which will fly later on this week. So I want to reassure people every arm of government is doing everything it possibly can to defeat the coronavirus and rise to the challenges that it presents us at home and abroad."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (02:23);Last night, Her Majesty, the Queen reflected on the national spirit of unity and resolve that we’re seeing in our country, as well as the collective effort we need to tackle the disease. From our heroic doctors, nurses and care workers, through to those manning the tills at supermarkets and pharmacies, those driving the lorries and the buses, they’re all worthy of our applause, they’re all worthy of our admiration."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (02:49);And on that note, both the Prime Minister and I would like to thank all of the NHS staff for their truly heroic work, and we urge the public to continue to follow the government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives. And on that note, I’m going to pass it over to Angela for an update on the latest data."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (03:08);Thank you. If I could start with a first slide, this is about the work that we have all been doing in order to stay at home. So what you see that is how much change there’s been in how we use transport. And the orange line, I think is the one that shows us across the whole country how national rail usage has fallen right down to below 20% of what it was during February. And you can see with other ways of moving around, they’re also much, much lower than you would normally expect at this time of year. You can see that on the 23rd of March, so two weeks ago today, it really, really fell very dramatically."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (03:51);The efforts all of us are making to stay at home and save lives are working. There are, if I could have the next slide, the growth in the number of cases in our hospitals is not as bad as it would have been if we had not made these efforts. So it is working, but the big question is, is the virus spread slowing down enough to make hospital admissions stabilize and then even full?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (04:21);If I could have the next slide, please. So these are people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 across different regions of Great Britain. And what you can see is that having risen very steadily up until around about the 1st of April, they’re now starting to [inaudible 00:04:42] more complicated behavior and starting, we hope, to slow down. But it really is too soon to see the effects of the big changes we all made to our lives from the 23rd March onwards, because remember, that’s only two weeks ago, and it takes several weeks after you’ve become infected for you to realize that you’re ill enough that you really need to be in hospital. So we’re all watching these numbers very, very carefully and we’re very much hoping that what’s going to happen next is they will at least stop rising."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (05:19);Next slide, please. The final set of numbers to look at today is the global comparisons of this very sad deaths from COVID. And this is the most late data. So these are data that show the date of reporting of deaths, and that can take a very long time after someone’s died, and can be rather variable how long that takes in different countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (05:45);And we will expect even if the number of people being admitted to hospitals and ITU units does start to stabilize, certainly we do expect this number to keep on rising because of course it takes time after people have been admitted to hospital for them either to get better, or very sadly, to die. And then of course it further takes time for those deaths to be reported. So I’ll stop there and hand back to Dominic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (06:11);Angela, thank you very much. So I’m very happy to take questions. Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Laura Kuenssberg: (06:17);Thanks very much, Foreign Secretary. Firstly, on the Prime Minister, if the Prime Minister is ill enough to need to be in hospital, how can he be well enough to run the country at a time of national emergency? Wouldn’t it be better if he step back, even briefly, in order to recover properly? And if I could ask the medics, you say that the restrictions are working but too early to tell the longterm effects, but what would your view on what are likely exit strategy from the restrictions be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (06:48);Thanks, Laura. Well, first of all, on the PM, he was admitted to hospital for tests as a precaution only. And that was because some of the symptoms that he had when he first tested positive had persisted. He’s had a comfortable night in St. Thomas’, he’s in good spirits and he’s being readily updated. And he still remains in charge of the government, and we’re getting on with all of the various strands of work to make sure at home and abroad we can defeat the virus and pull the country through coronavirus and the challenges that undoubtedly we’re facing at the moment. Angela, do you want to comment on the [crosstalk 00:07:21]?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (07:19);Yes. Our advice has been very straightforward, that we need a good, long time series of data on all of these stages of infection in order to be able to tell what the impact or the measures that came in on the 23rd of March are going to be. It’s too early to tell yet. We need to carry on following those instructions so that we can work out three weeks later what actually happens in hospitals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (07:50);Does that give you the answers you need or do you want to come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Laura Kuenssberg: (07:54);I’m just wondering, there is increasing discussion about what the exit strategy from these restrictions should be. I would be interested to hear Angela or professor, what’s his view on what they might anticipate given all the-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Laura: (08:03);… uncertainties around?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (08:05);Again, our suggestion has been completely clear. We need to know how well the current restrictions are working before we can say anything sensible about what the next stage might be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (08:19);The number one priority, Laura, right now is to stop the spread and to make sure that we can get past the peak, and I think that’s the overriding focus of the government right now. And the other decisions can be considered in light of the evidence that we’re taking from Angela and Chris in due course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (08:38);Beth Rigby from Skye."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Beth Rigby: (08:41);Thank you. Foreign Secretary, one of your team, African Minister James Dotteridge, today urged the Prime Minister to rest up and let others do the heavy lifting until he gets better. Do you not agree that the Prime Minister at this moment needs to rest, not work? And a question to Professor Witty first, welcome back, it’s nice to see you back. We’re entering the third week of lockdown. The government said it would review the lockdown at the end of this week. Given we’re now approaching the peak of the epidemic, will you be advising the ministers to keep these measures in place? And can you give the British people a sense of whether this will continue for weeks or months? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (09:27);Well on your question about the PM, look he’s in charge but you’re right, he’ll continue to take doctor’s advice on what to do next. And we have a team which in the way I describe is full throttle, making sure that his directions and his instructions are being implemented and followed through, whether it’s the purchase of ventilators through to the diplomatic effort to return UK nationals who are stranded abroad. But as ever, the Prime Minister will take the medical advice that he gets from his doctor. Chris?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (09:58);Just to add, and I’m basically going to say exactly the same thing that Angela said earlier, which is the key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we’ve reached the peak, and this is now beyond the peak, and at that point I think it is possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do, step by step to move to the next phase of managing this. But I think to start having that discussion until we’re confident, that’s what we’ve got to, would I think be a mistake."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (10:26);Robert Peston, ITV. Oh sorry Beth, did you want to come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Beth Rigby: (10:29);Yeah. Just to follow up Professor Witty though, just to be clear, given that we are approaching the peak and it’s the end of the week whereby the government will review whether to relax restrictions, it seems to me you are saying that the lockdown measures will continue beyond this end of this week?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (10:45);Well, I think to be clear, we do not think we know for certain that the peak will be at the end of this week. This was the point that Angela was making earlier, and I think until we’re confident we’re there, that will be too early to start calling the point where we can move to the next phase of this epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (11:03);The government’s number one priority, its overriding priority is to get past the peak, and we do that by stopping the spread, which is why those decisions and those considerations, Beth, you right referred to, will have to wait until we’re beyond that point. Robert Peston, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Robert Peston: (11:21);Couple of questions, probably for the two scientific experts. First for Professor Witty, I think none of us could really know quite how much burden it is even [inaudible 00:11:38] in the peak of health to be prime minister. The normal advice when somebody’s been as ill as the current prime minister is to rest in order to get better. He’s not superhuman. Some would argue that he is taking too much of a risk to the extent to which he’s still working. So as a doctor, Professor Witty, I want you to wonder if you could comment a bit on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Robert Peston: (12:02);Secondly, I completely understand why you are saying we cannot outline a plan for lifting the restrictions until we know whether the current measures are working. But equally the damage from a prolonged economic lockdown will be tremendous in the sense that as an economy, we simply won’t be able to generate revenues, pay taxes to public services and the rest. So I do think the British people would want to feel that the government is working on a workable strategy, and in particular, is it possible to exit the lockdown unless and until we have a program of mass testing for the virus, and unless and until we have technological solutions of tracing people who may have come into contact with those who have the virus?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (12:54);Well, I’ll let Chris comment on the technical aspects, but first of all, just be clear, the prime minister, both in terms of going into Saint Thomas’ yesterday was taking the advice of doctors. So, he’s followed the doctor’s advice there and in terms of his recovering in the days ahead, will continue to do so. And just again on the exit strategy, let’s be clear about this… I’ll let Chris talk to the technical points, but the risk right now is if we take our focus off the strategy, which is beginning to work, is that we won’t get through the peak as fast as we need to, which is why it’s perfectly legitimate to ask the question, but the government’s overriding priority has got to be to keep up the work that and the commitment that so many people have made, to make sure that we maintain the social distancing, we stop the spread, we protect the NHS as we come through the peak. Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (13:46);So my advice to the prime minister was to take the medical advice of the excellent NHS doctors who are advising him, and I’m sure he’ll continue to do that. The only bit of advice I gave him in addition to that was as is widely reported, I did advise him to get tested in the first place because I thought that was prudent. But after that, I didn’t wish to muddle my role with him. I’m not his medical practitioner. I’m his advisor on wider issues."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (14:09);In terms of the points you make about there must be planning for next phase. Of course there is, and it’s quite complicated. There are a very large number of technical elements which need to be brought together. Testing is one of them, but it also involves, for example, considering the likelihood of a variety of different other technologies including vaccines, including drugs and when they’re likely to be available. I think the one thing I would say at this point is we’ve got to remember just from the health point of view and clearly there are wider social and economic issues as well, but there are at least four different kinds of mortality and ill health we need to take into account over the period of this epidemic. There’s the direct effects of people dying from Coronavirus. There’s the indirect effects of the NHS if it were to become overwhelmed and therefore unable to provide emergency care for either Coronavirus or other areas."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (15:10);And all the activities we’re doing at the moment are to make sure that both of those are minimized. But it is really important also to remember that there will be effects from the fact that some healthcare has had to be postponed to make room for this within the NHS. And of course anything that has an impact on the socioeconomic status, particularly of people who are more deprived, will have a longterm health impact as well. And we have to, in our exit strategy, balance all of these different elements, which to some extent can be intention. So, I think it’s just important to understand, this is going to be quite a complicated set of trying to work out how different things fit together as we move to the next phase of this epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (15:51);Does that address your questions Rob?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Robert Peston: (15:54);Except, I’m just being thick I suppose, but I don’t really understand why talking about, even if it’s in the long term, the way we’re going to exit, it somehow distracts-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Professor Whitty: (16:03);… from the imperative of social distancing. I think everyone accepts that social distancing is absolutely vital. But why do people hope that there is a plan to exit? Why would this act reduce the urgency for people who are doing what they’re doing now?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (16:18);Well, the two reassurances I can give you that that works so that we can properly assess the measures that we introduced is in place, but also that we do not want to confuse the message right now because we are not past the peak. To get past the peak, we must have people respecting those guidelines, otherwise we undo all the good work that so many people have achieved and contributed to through their forbearance, particularly as the weather gets a bit warmer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Angela McLean: (16:44);We can only make calculations about what we might do next if we have some reasonable data on how large the impact of what we’ve done is so far and we can really only start to collect that from now because we’re now about two weeks after people would have gotten infected on the 23rd of March or later."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (17:06);Thanks, Angela. Victoria McDonald, Channel Four"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Victoria McDonald: (17:09);Thank you very much. I was wondering how does the number of patients in ITU beds in London right now compare with what you’d been planning at this stage? Is there any suggestion that maybe you won’t need as many beds at the ExCel Centre at the Nightingale as you had expected?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (17:30);I don’t know whether Angela or Chris, you want to …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Speaker 1: (17:34);[crosstalk 00:17:33]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (17:34);I mean there’s a very long answer and a very short answer. The very short answer is our principle aim in both the fantastic response from the general public in terms of social distancing and all the things people have done and not done on that and also off the NHS stuff we built things up is to ensure that the gap between the number of beds available for intensive care and those that are needed is always in a situation where we have some room to spare. If we end up in a situation where we have more ICU beds at all times during this epidemic than we absolutely need to deal both with COVID and other areas, that will be a success. That is something which is critical for our overall aim. So that’s in a sense is what we would like to see is some head room between what we need and what we’ve got available at any given time. Both for COVID and for other conditions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (18:30);Of course, that’s got to take into account the regional distribution of the need, which is why as well as HMS Nightingale in London, we’ve got the other plans to build in Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol and Harrow Gate. Did you want to come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Victoria McDonald: (18:46);Well, I just wondered where we are at the moment. If you look at the modeling and you refer back to some of the slides you’ve just shown, is it the case that ITU is performing better now than you had actually expected at this point?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (19:00);Well, we’re not remotely complacent and we’re doing everything we can to make sure we’ve not only got the capacity but a bit of room for maneuver as Chris has mentioned."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (19:11);Tom Newton Dunn from The Sun."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Tom Newton Dunn: (19:16);Foreign secretary, thank you very much. Back on to the prime minister’s condition, if you don’t mind. Two factual questions for you, foreign secretary. Have you spoken to Boris Johnson today either by text or telephone and have you taken over any of his security responsibilities or is he also on that from his hospital bed?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Tom Newton Dunn: (19:34);To CMO, if I may, can you explain why you recommended he go into the hospital for testing and can you possibly have a go at answering the question the foreign secretary didn’t answer, explaining the contradiction why the prime minister is sick enough to take up a valuable hospital bed, but well enough to still be running the country?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (19:52);Well, Tom, I’m not going to comment on security matters, but I spoke to the PM over the weekend. I chaired the morning meeting that he would normally chair. He’s being kept abreast of all the relevant developments. Of course, in terms of the balance that you described, and I’ll of course let Chris comment, that’s something that he will decide based on the medical advice he’s received from his doctor. Chris, do you want to add-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (20:16);Yeah, I want to be clear. It was not me who recommend that he went into hospital, that’s entirely between him and his excellent NHS team. The only thing I recommended was that he got tested in the first point, place. I completely agree that this is a question for discussion between him and his medical advisors who are outstanding."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (20:33);Tom, do you want a come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Tom Newton Dunn: (20:36);Yeah, please. I mean, clearly the country is in some doubt over exactly how well the prime minister is. Mr. [Whitty 00:00:20:42], can you possibly explain, is he in risk of catching pneumonia? Does he have pneumonia? Or is there no chance of that at all?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Professor Whitty: (20:50);I’m absolutely not going to discuss any individual patient nor, to be clear, do I actually have all the details, nor should I because this is an issue between him and his medical advisors. I can give a general answer which is the majority, the clear majority of people who do end up going to hospital, they end up going into a general bed. They may or may not need oxygen and other things and they don’t need to go further than that. But that is absolutely not a comment on his personal situation, which would be completely inappropriate for me to comment on. It’s just a general comment on how things tend to progress in hospital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (21:25);Chris Smyth from The Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Smyth: (21:26);Thank you. First can I ask Professor Whitty, the government today has conceded that no antibody tests that it or anyone else has developed is yet good enough for their purposes and scientists talk about working with companies to improve the products on offer because it isn’t nearly yet. Can I ask you about timing? At exactly what stage of the epidemic do you want to be using a mass home antibody test? At what level of population, level of infection would this be needed? Does there come a point where if no improvement can be made, the tests we have now will have to be good enough?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Smyth: (21:59);Can I also ask, foreign secretary, you chaired the coronavirus meeting this morning, you’re here this afternoon, if the country and the prime minister needs it, do you feel ready to take charge of government?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (22:12);Chris, you want to go first?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (22:14);Okay. On the antibody tests, so the antibody tests are at there most useful at a later stage of the epidemic. At this point in time, we would expect quite a small proportion of the population has probably got antibodies. There’s two reasons for that. There’s the proportion actually infected and then there’s a period of time between someone getting an infection and antibodies being routinely available, routinely detectable. It depends which kind of antibody you’re talking about, how soon that is. But most of the tests for, most of the labs who’ve looked at this would say 21, 28 days would be the kind of timescale you’d be talking about. They do tend to be more effective later in the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (23:02);In terms of the current tests we’ve got at the moment, you’ve got to remember this is a new disease to which we have had absolutely no knowledge at the beginning of January, and inevitably we’re feeling our way to some extent. I am very confident we will develop antibody tests, whether they be lab-based or a dipstick-based over the next period, I’m very confident of that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (23:25);But the fact that we have not in our first pass in the first things that people were produced got ones which are highly effective is not particularly surprising to anybody who understands how tests are developed. I would expect those to continue to improve both on, potentially on the dipstick side and definitely on the lab side, which would be available in due course through the NHS over time. The more accurate they are, the more useful they need to be for us. They will become more accurate as time goes by. I think the situation we’ll find ourselves in in a few months and possibly a few weeks will be considerably different to what we find ourselves in at the moment. But I think it made a lot of –"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (24:03);… sense to get started early on this, because this is clearly something which, in the long run is going to be very important for how we manage this epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (24:11);And look, on the question to me, the prime minister is in charge, he’s leading the government, and giving directions as and when required. And of course, as you mentioned, I chaired the 9:15 morning meeting, the whole team is focused on delivering those instructions, so I’m not going to get into any hypotheticals. Did you want to come back on either of those points?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Smyth: (24:31);[crosstalk 00:24:30]. Professor [Witty 00:00:32], you talked about the lab based tests. Does that suggest that we may have to give up on an idea of a home based, instant reading test, and just go back to a system where you have to send results back to a lab?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (24:43);No, it doesn’t. It just means that, inevitably the reason that the UK went for quite a lot of tests of different types to begin with is to try a variety of different ones and see which ones work. We expect the technology to improve over time, so I certainly do not think we will be giving up on this at this point. But inevitably, it’s going to take a while before we get to the optimal test performance. That is, it would be very surprising if first out of the gate, we’ve got to the best outcome that we could for these kinds of tests."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Smyth: (25:13);Anna from the telegraph."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Anna: (25:18);Dominic Raab, could you first just clarify your answer to [inaudible 00:25:20] earlier? And are you saying that you have not spoken to the prime minister today? And secondly, which you can see, that there is an importance to giving businesses an idea of when, of what kind of exit strategy the government has, and a rough idea of how long it would take, and whether it would be say, standard by region or by type of person? And are these kind of things under consideration? And just a question for Chris Witty, in your medical opinion, should individuals who’ve been hospitalized with coronavirus continue to work from their hospital beds?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (25:57);Thanks. So, I spoke to the PM on Saturday, was the last time I spoke to him in person. And in relation to your other questions, so, obviously we’re very mindful of the challenges businesses are facing, small businesses, all employers, and of course the workforce as well. But the risk is, if we start taking our eye off the ball of tackling the greater virus, stopping the spread, and getting through the peak, we risk delaying the point at which we could, in the future, take those decisions on easing restrictions. So, it is really important right now to keep the overriding focus on maintaining the discipline that we’ve had, keeping adherence to the guidelines that the government has set out, and making sure that we stop the spread of coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Chris Witty: (26:45);And making a general point as a doctor, patients of mine, and to be clear, that is definitely not the prime minister, but patients of mine, there are some who are in a hospital bed but are perfectly capable of managing massively complicated things from the hospital bed, others clearly are not. That is absolutely a conversation between the individual and the doctors and nurses who are looking after them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (27:07);Did you want to come back on either of those points?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Anna: (27:12);Yeah, I mean, on the exit strategy, we know that different departments are already starting to look at what kind of things can be done in their fields, and I’m [inaudible 00:27:21] number 10 on that. Wouldn’t it help business confidence to give some sort of idea of what’s on the table?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (27:29);Well, I think the risk is, and it would undermine business confidence if we took our foot off the pedal and eased up on the restrictions right now. And as a result of that, we found that we weren’t stopping the spread of the disease as quickly as we otherwise could. And I think a lot of business community will understand that. Of course, all of the review and the measures to make sure that we can review the effectiveness of the measures in the way that Angela has described, all of that work is going on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (28:02);[Stephan 00:28:02] from [inaudible 00:04:02]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Stephan: (28:05);Thank you. Foreign secretary, thousands of small businesses across the country are waiting on advice about when [inaudible 00:28:12] will be in practice. Can you say today if there will be wage relief for all those businesses by this month’s payday? And furthermore, with only 1000 business lines so far agreed upon by banks through your business loan scheme, does this show that banks are [inaudible 00:28:34] to loan out to businesses? And what more can the government do to ensure that banks act in the national interest through this time?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (28:42);Well, the chancellor’s already announced a 330 billion pound package to support businesses right the way through to employees. He will set out the further detail as necessary, as soon as practical. Of course, we do want to encourage banks to be lending and providing the liquidity, particularly that small and medium size businesses need, so that is important and we do want that message along with the support we’ve given to small businesses and banks, to be conveyed as clearly as possible and to be [inaudible 00:29:10]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Stephan: (29:10);Just as a follow-up, I do understand that have said this to banks and you have said that it is important to act on this, but is there anything you can actually do to twist the arms of banks to ensure they do act in this way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-6","Dominic Raab: (29:23);Well, the treasury ministers are in regular contact with the banks. We’re looking at both what they need, but also critically, how we get the finance to the businesses which are viable but are just struggling with the challenge of coronavirus. And we want to make sure, particularly those vulnerable small businesses and medium size businesses can see their way through this crisis. And I know the chancellor and the treasury team are doing everything they can to make sure that that can be done. Thank you all very much."

I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team. The prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss, but also my friend and my thoughts are with him and his family. The news about the PM reminds us how indiscriminate this disease is. Nearly everyone will know someone who’s been affected. Friends, family, neighbors, colleagues. This is a terrible virus that respects no boundaries of status or geography or vocation."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (00:38);But we are not facing it alone. We are all taking part in a collective national effort to protect the vulnerable and each other to secure our public services and to save lives. This endeavor is underpinned by an important, simple idea that we depend on each other. When you need it, when you fall on hard times, we will all as one society be there for you to take care of you until you are once again ready to take care of yourself and others. This idea has been central to all of our efforts to support people and businesses during this crisis. We promise to do whatever it takes and I am striving every day to keep that promise."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (01:36);But when I say we all depend on each other, I don’t just mean the relationship between individuals, businesses and the state. One of our greatest strengths as a country is our civil society, the local charities who provides so much compassion, care and community to the most vulnerable in our country. You have not been forgotten. British people, businesses and foundations are already doing their part to support our charity sector. And today we in government will do our part as we build on our plan for the economy with a plan to support our social fabric."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (02:19);There are nearly 170,000 charities in this country and the truth is we will not be able to match every pound of funding that they would have received this year. Charities can already use many of our existing schemes to support people and to protect their staff. All charities are eligible for the job retention scheme and in line with medical advice and just like any other employer, the right answer for many charities will be to furlough their employees."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (02:49);But some charities are on the front line of fighting the Coronavirus and others provide critical services and support to vulnerable people and communities. For them, shutting up shop at this moment would be to contravene their very purpose, their entire reason to exist. Those charities have never been more needed than they are now and they’ve never faced such a sudden fall in their funding. So today I’m announcing £750 million of funding for the charity sector. £370 million of that funding will support small, local charities working with vulnerable people. We all know who they are. Those small charities in our villages, our market towns, in pockets of our cities. The unsung heroes looking after the vulnerable and holding together our social fabric."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (03:46);In England, this support will be provided through organizations like the National Lottery Community’s Fund and we will allocate £60 million of this funding through the Barnett formula to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The UK government will also provide £360 million directly to charities providing essential services and supporting vulnerable people as we battle the Coronavirus. Up to £200 million of those grants will support hospices with the rest going to organizations like St. John’s Ambulance and the Citizens Advice Bureau as well as charities supporting vulnerable children, victims of domestic abuse or disabled people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (04:29);And last night the BBC announced their Big Night In charity appeal on April the 23rd. and today I can confirm that the government will match pound for pound whatever the public decides to donate, starting with at least £20 million to the National Emergencies Trust Appeal."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (04:54);Two short weeks ago, I spoke of the need for kindness, decency and the sort of neighborliness that is at the heart of these charitable and community efforts. The normally invisible connections between us have in recent weeks become more apparent. For most of us, we spend our lives oblivious to these connections, these bonds, and how our behaviors, however small, can have a dramatic effect on others. But these bonds are not invisible for our local charities. For the volunteer, keeping victims of domestic violence safe. For the outreach worker, helping a rough sleeper find a bed or for the support worker manning the phones to help stave off the heart wrenching loneliness so many of our elderly relatives and friends will be experiencing right now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (05:45);These connections might be hard to see, but they are there and they are strengthened by our compassion for others. Charities embody this like no other organization and their lesson is that the simplest acts have the potential to change lives. At this time when many are hurting and tired and confined, we need the gentleness of charities in our lives. It gives us hope. It makes us stronger and it reminds us we depend on each other. Thank you. If we could now take some questions, I believe. Angela, were you going to present your slides first?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela McLean: (06:37);If I may."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (06:37);Perfect."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela McLean: (06:38);I wanted to start by showing this data, which is a record of how much we’ve acted together to reduce how much we contact each other. So what’s shown here is footfall at 17 stations across the country counting how many people pass through their stations at different times through the month of March. And what you see is that at the end of March, footfall was down 94% compared to the first week of March. And in the next slide, what you can see is that that has worked in the sense that this count of new cases in the UK day by day over the last few weeks is not accelerating out of control. Yesterday there were 5,492 new cases and the spread of this virus is not accelerating, and that is good news. If I could have the next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela McLean: (07:43);What’s recorded here is people in hospital beds with COVID and the highest of those lines is London and the one just below in gray is the Midlands. What this is is a slower responding record of new infections because of course once people are in hospital, some of them will have to stay there for many days, some of them for some weeks. But again, what we see is that the rate at which this is rising is definitely getting slower and it looks like we’re beginning to get towards a flat curve there, which is of course what we’ve all wanted."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela McLean: (08:23);Our overall aim has always been to make sure that everybody can have access to critical care if they need it and that’s what’s shown on the next slide is COVID patients in critical care. Back one please. Can I get back one please? No, okay. This one here. Yes, thank you. And there we can see encouraging news that perhaps at least in some parts of the country, this really has started to flatten. Across the country, in the last 24 hours, this has increased by just 4%. And again, that is good news because this is our most limiting resource at the moment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela McLean: (09:09);So finally, I have data on the sad statistic of people who have died from COVID, and this is an international comparison across different countries showing how that number accumulates in different countries. And UK is the dark blue line somewhere in the middle there. This data has long reporting lags and even after the number of people in critical care stabilizes or even maybe begins to fall, this number will rise because sometimes deaths are reported many, many days or even a week or so after sadly somebody has died. So we expect this number to keep rising even after the curve has flattened. Thank you Chancellor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (09:54);Thank you. Stephen, anything you wanted to add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (09:57);Maybe a word on charities. So in the NHS we work very closely with our partners in the charitable section and I know it’s really important that not only we all support them during this difficult time, but it’s also really important to recognize the support that they are giving everybody to help them through the time where we are asking people to stay at home and take the measures that we have indicated. I have the real privilege at NHS England of leading the cardiovascular, that’s heart attacks and stroke strategy. Two charities I work very closely with: the British Heart Foundation, the Stroke Association, and I know they would want me to say today, to remind everybody that the NHS has worked night and day to surge capacity to manage Coronavirus. But it is also there for you if you have symptoms of a stroke, symptoms of a heart attack. Indeed, if you have any emergency condition, whether it’s a sick child, whether it’s a mother, or a mother in pregnancy who’s worried about the movements of the baby, you should be seeking emergency…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (11:03);… services just as you always have done. They are there for you and although we are focusing on Coronavirus, it’s important that we also continue to focus on other emergency conditions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (11:18);Thank you, Steve. If we take some questions, I think first up is Laura Kuenssberg from BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Laura Kuenssberg: (11:24);Thank you, Chancellor. You keep saying whatever it takes to help people through this time and with support from the economy. But do you accept, Chancellor, that under the lockdown there is a tradeoff between protecting people’s health and protecting people’s jobs?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (11:40);Thanks, Laura. Well, I think we’ve been clear. Our priority is to protect people’s lives, their health and wellbeing. That is our absolute overriding priority. But alongside that, in a coordinated, I think, coherent and consistent fashion, we have also put in place unprecedented and significant measures to protect people’s jobs, their incomes, their livelihoods, and the businesses that employ them. I think that’s the right approach. What it does, it means that we can mitigate as much of the economic impact as possible and ensure that as soon as we can get through this, that we can bounce back as quickly as possible. Was there anything that you wanted to follow up on for either of anyone else?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Laura Kuenssberg: (12:26);Yeah. Do you accept though that some people are falling through the cracks? I mean, the Treasury Select committee this afternoon has said that you need to take urgent action for some people who aren’t covered by your very extensive scheme. Do you think the public should be prepared for a serious downturn, maybe even a recession?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (12:42);I think I’ve been very clear and very honest that this will have a significant impact on our economy. That’s not uncommon with every other major country that’s grappling with this. We will all see a significant impact on our economy. And I’ve also been very honest that in spite of what are unprecedented measures in scale and scope, I can’t stand here and say that I can save every single job, protect every single business or indeed every single charity, the focus of today’s announcements. That’s just simply not possible. But what we can do is put in place what I think is an enormous amount of support in a targeted fashion as best as possible to help as many people as possible get through this so that as I said, we can emerge on the other side of it stronger, united, and hopefully able to bounce back as quickly as possible. I think if we turn next to, is it Tom Clark from ITV? Tom, are you there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Tom Clark: (13:36);Hello, yes, I am. Thank you, Chancellor. My question relates to testing. Yesterday’s briefing with the Chief Medical Officer may be honest admission that Germany’s lower death toll in their pandemic is due to their ability to test more people more quickly. Given that death toll is three times lower than ours, is it now time for the government to come out and admit that thousands of people have died and thousands more people will die in this country as a result of our failure to test more people more rapidly?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (14:10);Would you comment to testing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (14:11);To be honest, I don’t think that’s what the Chief Medical Officer did say. I think he said that tasting was one of many factors, and I think the Chief Scientific Advisor spoke about this too, was one of a range of things in Germany. I think it’s difficult at this stage to say what range of factors has contributed to what. I think the Chief Medical Officer was also making clear that it’s important that all countries learn from each other. I’ve no doubt that other countries will want to learn from our experience and some of the things that we have done in the United Kingdom, for instance, the work on modeling and predicting what the epidemic might do. I think the point he was making yesterday was that everybody should be learning from each other. Indeed, that is what we’re doing. Angela might have more to say on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (14:58);Yes, I would have thought the point would be that the rate of deaths, of course, appears much lower if you can count many, many more of the cases. That’s certainly one of the things that you see. If you see different case fatality rates in countries, that could be because you’re counting many, many more of the people who should be on the bottom of that fraction. In terms of modeling, that is something that we’re really very happy in this country to offer to other countries and hope that’s one of the things we can contribute to the international effort."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (15:31);Thank you, Tom. I hope, I hope that …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Tom Clark: (15:35);Like you, I just sat through the Select Committee hearing on which you were a witness. We heard from the people in charged of testing in South Korea and in Hong Kong. They made it abundantly clear testing has reduced the numbers of cases of Coronavirus in those countries. Dr. Whitty did say yesterday that it was, in fact, Germany’s tests that was part of their lower death rates. We had less than certain. He did not speak of that. It is about testing. Can you tell me whether our inability to test will lead to greater mortality here? Can I also follow-up? How dependent is the UK on a testing regime, for us to be able to lift lockdown restrictions and are we on course to have the sufficient levels of testing in the community to allow us to do that in anything like the next three or four weeks?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (16:27);I think we all agree that testing is important. That is not the issue at all. I think the point I was making is that testing is one part of a set of different things that will need to be considered in any country’s strategy. That is the case here. It is the case in Germany. I have spoken to Chief Medical Officer today and I think, well, I know the point he was making yesterday, was it is a part of the overall strategy. I think it is almost certainly too early, in all countries’ experience, to know exactly which components or strategies have been the most effective or have been most important. It’s highly likely it’s the combination of these things rather than one any individual part of an approach."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (17:12);Brilliant. Thank you. Tom. Can we turn to Andy Bell from Channel 5?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Andy Bell: (17:16);Yes, thank you. I want to follow up partly on Tom’s question about the lockdown but in a different context, which is the First Minister of Wales has said today that as far as he’s concerned a lockdown is going to continue beyond next week in Wales. Can you level with us now and just accept that the lockdown is going to continue across the U.K. through next week? From a scientific and medical point of view, is it possible or even desirable that different parts of the country could come out of lockdown at different speeds?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (17:52);Let me address that before handing over, Andy. I can just say there will be a cover meeting tomorrow chaired by the First Secretary of State involving the devolved administrations to talk about the approach to the review. We committed that there would be a review in and around three weeks. That review will be based on the evidence and the data provided by Sage, which will only be available next week. But I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus very seriously on the here and now and the present. I think there the messages unequivocal. Our priority right now is to stop the spread of this virus, to get the the other side of the peak. And the best way to do that is for people to follow the advice, which is to stay at home, protect lives, and protect the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (18:39);I think, in terms of messaging, I would want to be absolutely unequivocal about that. That’s where we are now. That’s the advice people should be following. That’s the best thing that we can all do to help get through this as quickly as possible. But Angela, if you wanted to add anything on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (18:53);We have always said that we would need to be able to see what impact the whole suite of interventions that were brought into place on the 23rd of March are having before we can make any evidence-based decision on what to do next. This week is a really important week. We’re all watching what happens. I guess from a purely scientific point of view, more data is better for us. But I completely agree with the Chancellor that what really matters is that people stay home, protect lives, and save the NHS. Or is it the other way around?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (19:31);Brilliant. And I hope, does that answer your question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Andy Bell: (19:34);I’d just like to come back to the idea of whether different parts of the country could theoretically emerge at different times from lockdown. Whether that’s, first of all, politically possible, and secondly, whether that’s in any way scientifically or medically desirable."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (19:50);I think what I’d probably say before handing over to Angela on the medical issues, I think, again, I don’t want to start speculating about the future. I think that’s not helpful at this juncture. I think the key thing now is for people to focus unequivocally on the advice. We are where we are in this process, and the advice is clear. People should follow the advice. That’s the best thing that everyone can do wherever they live in this country at the moment. I think Angela probably would echo that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (20:16);I would echo that. I don’t want to get into hypotheticals about what might be better one way or another. I suspect that simple strategies might well turn out to be the best to use, but we’ll see and I’m going to get it right this time. The advice is for Easter weekend to stay home, protect the NHS, and save lives. So I will certainly be having my Easter at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (20:39);Thank you, Andy. Gary Gibbon from Channel 4."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Andy Gibbon: (20:44);Thank you. Chancellor, can I ask you. We’ve had unemployment figures from one European country so far, post-COVID crisis: Norway. Unemployment, well over 10%. From the data you look at in the Treasury, can you hand on heart say we’re not going to see something like that here?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (21:05);Gary, I will be absolutely honest, this will have a significant impact on our economy and not in an abstract way. It will have an impact on people’s jobs and their livelihoods and that’s why we’ve taken the actions that we have in order to help mitigate some of that. I believe that, for example, the job retention scheme, the furlough scheme that we’ve put in place, which we’ve never had anything like in this country. As I said, when I stood here to announce it, the government is stepping in to help pay people’s wages so that they’re not laid off, so they don’t end up being unemployed, that they remain attached to their company, with a very significant safety net behind them that helps the company, that helps the person, that helps their family finances. I think that, and to combine with all the other measures we’ve taken, will significantly help mitigate some of the impact."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (21:51);I think that’s what other commentators have said as well. That if we weren’t doing all the things that we’re doing, if we won’t put in place these unprecedented measures, it would certainly be worse. I believe we’re doing the right things. I can’t-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (22:03);… stand here and say that there isn’t going to be hardship ahead. There is, which is why going through this together as one society united, understanding that everyone’s got a role to play, whether that’s government, business, charities, your next door neighbor. I think that’s the best approach to this, but I’m confident we will get through it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Speaker 2: (22:21);Is some of that … Is some of the data from surveys already coming in outstripping your expectations? You mentioned the furloughs scheme, some suggestion that there could be people applying for that, businesses applying for that way in excess, maybe, in treasury expectations. Did you ever think you could be forking out say 40 billion over three months, which could be the number, couldn’t it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (22:44);Well, I think just to clarify on that, we have not put out a specific projection or an estimate of the take up of that scheme and I think there was some reporting that we might have and this might be an assessment, so we haven’t actually done that for the simple reason … This is an unprecedented situation, so of course we have a range of scenarios that might come our way, but there isn’t a precise central estimate of of what the scheme might do. What I would say is you’re right, there is other data that we can look at and I think others and myself have talked about universal credit claims which have come down from where they were 10 days ago, which is comforting, but they’re still very elevated relative to what normal levels might be, sometimes four or five times higher."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (23:24);That is obviously something we look at and that’s why we’ve not only strengthened the safety net and put extra money to the tune of seven billion pounds plus into the welfare system for those who are accessing universal credit. We’ve also provided more funding to DWP, for example, to help them process those claims and make sure people get the support as quickly as they need. But I say when it comes to the job retention scheme, people who are put on that scheme at whatever scale, to me that’s the scheme working. The idea is that we did that so that people were not laid off, they were not unemployed, they had a good income to get them through this and they remain attached to their company and their employer. So if it ends up being significantly used I will view that as a success if it means that we get through this and then can bounce back quickly and provide security to those people and their families during it. Thank you. I think next Piper Quier at The Daily Mirror?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Piper Quier: (24:24);We all know that the focus now … The focus now is currently on following the advice, rightly, but I’ve spoken to head teachers and parents and MPs who are very keen to reopen schools as soon as the scientific advice suggests that it’s safe to do so. So can I ask Professor McLean whether … Despite the focus on the advice now, whether she could give us any indication of where schools might be open before the summer holidays, which after all are three months away, and the chancellor, if I can ask you how significant a factor are schools in your discussions about getting the economy back on its feet once we’re through the other side of this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Speaker 3: (25:12);I’m happy to answer that by saying there’s very intensive work going on to think about all sorts of different things that we might do in the next stage. It would be completely premature for me to give a yes or no answer to that question because so much depends on this question of how well have the measures put in on March the 23rd worked, and we can’t know that this week until we see a longer run of infections that have happened since that time. But please be assured that people are working incredibly hard to explore those sorts of questions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (25:48);Yeah, Piper, I probably can’t add much to what Angela said is that we are … In all these instances we are driven and basing our decisions on the science and what is best for controlling the spread of this virus and getting that [inaudible 00:26:02] number down. That’s been our approach to this thing all along and that will continue to be our approach. And I pay tribute to those who are helping keep our schools open for children of key workers. That is is valuable, and the work that they’re doing is, I believe, well supported by the Department of Education, but they also are owed our thanks for doing that, because that is vital at this time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Piper Quier: (26:24);Can I come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (26:25);Yeah, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Piper Quier: (26:27);I mean, I can understand that obviously the data and the science suggested it’s too soon to see. But Mr. Paris was talking just days ago about green shoots and so the beginnings of signs of the curve flattening, was that premature?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (26:41);No, I don’t think so because I think what I said last week was that the green shoots were occurring in some of the early things that we were seeing, such as the reduction in transport, the reduction in footfall that we describe in these press conferences, which recognizes that the British public is complying with instructions. And, as we’ve said, the message is we need to continue complying with those instructions on social distancing. So, so those green shoots over time translate into benefit in a reduction in the number of infections, a reduction in the number of hospitalizations, and then sadly, finally, into a reduction in the number of deaths. And I think as you have heard from Angela at the start of this press conference, we are starting to see a plateauing, the first signs of a plateauing infections and hospitalizations."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (27:33);If we had not taken those measures, if people had not complied with them, we would not be seeing that. We would be seeing an exponential curve and a set of graphs that were steeply rising. So we are beginning to see the benefits, I believe. But the really critical thing is that we have to continue following instructions. We have to continue following social distancing because if we don’t, the virus will start to spread again. And if it starts to spread again, then in a week or two’s time we will be seeing a set of figures which are not going in the direction that we want to see them. We will see increased pressure on the NHS, we will see increased numbers of deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (28:12);So this is not the time to become complacent. It’s not the time to think that the job has been done. This is the time to continue everybody continuing, whether, whether you’re me, whether your member of the public, frankly, whether you’re a football team, to continue to keep with social distancing and ensure that the hard work and that the hardship that that everybody is no doubt encountering leads to those benefits. That’s a simple message today and you’ve heard it time and time again and there are no apologies for giving it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (28:46);Great. Thank you Piper. Could we go next to … Is it Nathan Hall from The Express or no?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Nathan Hall: (28:52);Yes. Thank you chancellor. I’m just back to your job retention scheme. The head of revenue and customs has today warned that the scheme is open to fraud and abuse. Have you had any evidence that that is happening and would you urge employees to blow the whistle on firms that may be abusing this scheme?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (29:09);Yep, thanks. Look, what I would say is we’re obviously designing schemes at pace which haven’t been done before, and part of the reason that we’ve made some of the decisions that we’ve made in the design, whether it’s the job retention scheme or the self-employed, are deliberately to counter fraud, because obviously we want to make them as simple as possible and as accessible to as many people as possible whilst protecting the tax payer. Because ultimately this is all of our money that would need to be paid back at some point. So we want to make sure it’s targeted on people who really need it, and that has actually influenced some of the design choices we’ve made. That means some people might fall between the cracks. That means that there are people who are saying, “Well, can you not do it this way? Can you include us?”"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (29:48);And the reason we’ve not been able to do that is to protect against exactly that, exactly the risk of fraud or spurious claims that we won’t be able to verify or only verify with a very cumbersome manual process, which would delay the scheme’s implementation, which I think is not the right thing. So I’m confident that the decisions we’ve made will minimize the risk of fraud. Obviously the team are hard at work at the moment getting these schemes up and running and we will have as robust verification and auditing processes as possible to ensure that there isn’t fraud and that we can go and tackle it. But that’s why we’ve made some of the choices we’ve made and hopefully that … People will understand that and they hopefully have been reasonable about that when I’ve explained, well, this is why you have to be employed, for example, on this particular day."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (30:33);Because if you weren’t, then obviously there is the risk that you could create a brand new employment for someone who we’ve never heard of before and suddenly start getting money from the taxpayer for not a genuine case. And so that’s, for example, one of the reasons that we picked a cutoff date of February the 28th for that particular scheme, big part of that was preventing fraud. So hopefully that’s clear and Jim and the HMRC and his team are doing a fantastic job getting these things up and running. I think he talked a little bit about timing and we’re on track to deliver against the timelines that I outlined earlier, which is pleasing because this is a huge challenge for them and they’re doing a great job. Does that answer what you wanted?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Nathan Hall: (31:13);Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (31:13);Perfect. Thank you. James Taxfield, Mail Online?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","James Taxfield: (31:19);Thank you, chancellor. Churchill had a personal doctor and president Trump has a medical team, but the prime minister was left with persistent symptoms Rover a week and was only admitted to hospital after a video call with a GP. There doesn’t seem to have been a great deal of social distancing going on in Downing Street. Haven’t we failed to protect our key decision makers, and what needs to change for the future? Should we be more of a US style system with more protection?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (31:46);Well, I think I’ll … I’ll defer to Steve in a second, but I would say that I think the prime minister has received excellent care and advice every step of the process. At the end of the day, no matter … We’re all trying our absolute best, but none of us are superhuman and impervious to getting sick during this process. And that’s what makes this whole thing so awful for all of us. But as I’ve observed and seen, the advice, the care has been excellent. Not just beforehand but especially now at St. Thomas’s. [inaudible 00:32:15] if there’s anything you want to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (32:15);I’m actually confident the prime minister has and is receiving excellent medical care. I’m not his physician, he will have been advised by his own doctors, but I do know colleagues at St. Thomas’s Hospital. In fact, a couple of weeks ago I took the opportunity to visit St. Thomas’s Hospital visits, some of the critical care consultants, and I can’t tell you how impressed I was, and this is going back a few weeks, at the preparations that they were making, the details that they were thinking through in terms of how they would deal with an increase in patients with coronavirus. They are amongst the best critical care clinicians in the world. St. Thomas’s, even when I was a junior doctor many years ago, was world-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (33:03);… renowned for its critical care capacity. So I’m absolutely confident, absolutely confident, that my colleagues, all the clinical staff, doctors, nurses, and everybody else at Saint Thomas’s is providing exceptional world-class care."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (33:20);Brilliant. Thank you, Steve. Does that answer your question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Press Corps: (33:24);I was just going to say the point on the Downing Street social distancing, in hindsight, do you think that that could have been more rigorously observed there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (33:32);Well I think … Look, everyone is doing their best to follow the guidelines, whether it’s cabinet, we’ve conducted, I think for the first ever time, meetings via alternative means. And people are appropriately following all the guidance. That doesn’t mean that we can completely eliminate the spread of infection in this process. But I think the good news is, as I said, there’s good update on the prime minister’s condition. Those that have been away are, many of them now, returning to work. But I think whether people are away, or social distancing, or physically in the same place, the business of government, throughout all of this, has gone on, and it has gone on at pace. And the team, whether it’s politicians, cabinet ministers, civil servants, doctors and medical advisers are working night and day to make sure that we do what we need to to get the country through this and support the British people at this time. I can absolutely give you that assurance."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (34:24);Thank you. Can we turn to Tim Ross from Bloomberg? Tim, are you there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Tim Ross: (34:30);Hello, yes. Chancellor, you say the prime minister is improving. Do you expect to see him able to leave hospital next week sometime? What are your expectations there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Tim Ross: (34:42);Also on Brexit, Chancellor, you have said before that your very honest about the risks to the economy and the fact there will be a really significant impact, potentially a recession later this year. Do you really think it’s a good idea to leave the European Union if the UK economy is in, or just coming out of, a very deep recession?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Tim Ross: (35:01);And then to your two colleagues, the decision on whether to persist with the lockdown measures will be taken, [inaudible 00:02:07], you’re saying next week probably sometime. What will the full range of data that you’re analyzing be in order to take that decision? And are we at the beginning of the peak now? How far off is your best guess?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (35:26);If I could start, I think you talked about, ” Should we still leave the European Union?” I think. I mean, we have left the European Union, that has happened. What we’re doing now is just negotiating the final terms of our trading arrangements. That work is carrying on. And David Frost, the prime minister’s chief sherpa in this regard, held talks earlier this week with the deputy counterpart over at the EU. They’ve exchanged legal texts. They’ve set out some clarification that they both wanted from each other. And indeed I think David is talking to his direct counterpart, either later this week or next week, to plan the next steps for the meetings and continued negotiations over April and May. So I think we remain committed to the timeline of concluding those talks and negotiations. That work is happening, albeit over video conference rather than in person. So I think that’s a pretty clear statement of where we are on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (36:22);Angela, do want to take the question on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (36:24);Yes, very happy to take that question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (36:26);So one of the great strengths of the kinds of mathematical modeling that Sage is drawing on in order to give its advice is that it lets you pull together information from all sorts of different data streams. So my colleagues who are generating that advice will be using hard data on things like numbers of people arriving at hospital, numbers of people having to be admitted to critical care in hospital. But also things like that data on how many people are there in stations, survey data asking people, “Well precisely what behaviors have you toned down in the last few weeks?”"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (37:02);So I could actually bore you by telling you how many different data streams are under consideration. But that is the strength of that approach, is it lets you take a lot of different kinds of information and do the best job you can of synthesizing them together in order to understand the situation we have been in, in the past, that has brought us to where we are now, and then do what you can to project into the future what’s going to happen next."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Angela: (37:27);But I’m not going to do that right now because that’s something that we do in a rather formal process. The model has come to Sage, and then Sage puts that together, and we send it over to our politicians in order to make decisions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (37:43);Do you have anything you wanted to add finally?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Stephen Powis: (37:43);As you know, Sage has been publishing its material so that is available, and I think also to add that many of the academic groups that contribute to Sage publish their own research and modeling independently. And so that is there for all to see in terms of those key academic groups."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (38:01);Brilliant. Thank you. Well if I could possibly wrap up. Thank you Tim for that, and just say thank you to Angela. Thank you, Steve, for answering all the questions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-covid-19-briefing-transcript-april-8","Rishi Sunak: (38:12);Our announcement today was about supporting charities, who are a critical part of the social fabric of this country. It builds on the economic plan that we’ve already announced to protect people’s health and economic security by supporting public services like our NHS, backing business, and protecting people’s jobs and incomes. And if I could conclude by saying this: Our economic plan, and the plan for charities that we announced today, are built on one simple idea, that we depend on each other. Thank you."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a speech on COVID-19 on March 16, encouraging Britons to stop all non-essential travel and contact. He encouraged everyone to avoid pubs, restaurants, and the office if possible. Read the full transcript here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (00:00);As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time so that we minimize suffering and save life, and everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (00:22);Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today we need to go further because, according to SAGE, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies, it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve. And without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days. So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for 14 days. That means that, if possible, you should not go out even to buy food or essentials other than for exercise, and in that case, at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (01:45);And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now. So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theaters, and other such social venues. It goes to that saying, repeat the message, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to, and please go online rather than ringing NHS 111."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (02:36);Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women, and for those with some health conditions. And if you ask, “Well, why are we doing this now? Why now? Why not earlier or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure,” the answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives. And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities. And as we take these steps, we should be focusing on the most vulnerable. So, third, in a few days time, by this coming weekend, it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks. And again, the reason for doing this in the next few days rather than earlier or later is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, difficult for them, but I believe it’s now necessary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (04:10);And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease. And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others, and it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead. So to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we’re saying about avoiding non-essential contact and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants. Lastly, it remains true, as we said in the last few weeks, that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings, such as sporting events, are relatively low. But obviously, logically, as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it’s right that we should extend that advice to mass gatherings as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (05:26);And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings to deal with this emergency. So, from tomorrow we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (05:53);And I know that many people, including millions of fit and active people over 70, may feel, listening to what I’ve just said, that there is something excessive about these measures. But I have to say I believe they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimize suffering, and to give our NHS the chance to cope."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (06:29);Over the last few days, I’ve been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world, and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF, all those bodies in which we play a significant role. We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease, to keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need. And the UK is also at the front of the effort to back our business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (07:14);I know that we are today asking a lot of everybody. This is far more now than just washing your hands, though clearly, washing your hands remains important. But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses, in my experience, are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face. And I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and that you’re going to play."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (07:45);Our chief scientific advisor will now update us on where we are. Over to you, Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (07:50);Thank you. We’ve looked all along SAGE at measures that can save lives and protect people. The objectives, as I laid out last time, are to really suppress the curve in order to keep it below NHS capacity so that the NHS can cope, and to shield the vulnerable and those most likely to get severe disease so that we protect them across this period. Most people, it’s worth reminding us, have a mild disease, but some do not."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (08:29);This is a very fast-moving situation. The latest numbers that we reviewed at SAGE suggest that we’re entering a fast-growth period or on the cusp of doing so, and London is ahead of other parts of the country. We at the outset laid out a plan and advised that we would implement it, the measures, at the right stage and in the right combination, the right combination to ensure that we get the biggest impact. Unfortunately, that time is now for many of these measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (09:06);What we’re doing is implementing them actually at a stage of the epidemic which is a little bit earlier than has been done in some other countries given where we are in terms of the epidemic now. The measures have two objectives. One is to delay the transmission of this virus across the community, and the second is to keep people safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (09:32);The measures, as the Prime Minister has outlined, include whole household isolation. So if one person gets the symptoms of new, persistent cough or fever, the whole household stays isolated for 14 days. The reason it’s 14 days is the seven days for the person who’s got the infection, the incubation period that others may catch it, and the seven days after that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (10:03);We’re also recommending increased social distancing, that’s the phrase that you hear, which means trying to reduce contact between people. Again, to try to delay this transmission. That means where businesses can do it and where individuals can do it, homeworking is recommended. Unnecessary travel should be reduced and stopped. Avoiding gatherings and crowded places is important. And those gatherings, big or small, are important so that you get the whole thing together. It’s not just the size of a gathering, it’s actually all gatherings which become important. And reducing social contacts."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (10:46);There are specific measures for the vulnerable groups, the people who are most likely to get serious illness with this infection, and Chris Whitty will say more about that. Those measures would need to go on for 12 weeks or so across this period, maybe a little longer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (11:08);These measures, like case isolation that we talked about last week, staying at home if you’ve got the symptoms, these new measures have a big effect. This is not a series of small interventions. You would anticipate that this could have a dramatic effect to reduce the peak and to reduce death rate. They are not easy, but they are important, and they will have the effect if we all do it. This is a matter for us to take accountability, to make sure we help each other, protect ourselves and protect the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (11:49);It is also possible, as laid out in the plan, that other measures may be necessary, including at some point, as we’ve said, it may be necessary to think about things like school closures, but those things, again, need to be done at the right time, in the right way, at the right stage of the outbreak. I’ll hand over to Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (12:12);Thank you. I’m just going to add a few comments additionally from a medical point of view, but I’m not going to repeat points that have already been made. And the first thing is to make an obvious point that this is now a very global disease, and the way you deal with global pandemics is different in public health terms than the way you would deal with a localized outbreak where you’re the first country or a very significant region that has got it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (12:40);And the second point is the obvious point again, that in this country, this disease is now accelerating up the curve, but it is still at a low level, but it will accelerate up now really quite rapidly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (12:54);Now, we obviously need to do things that are both effective, and all the measures that are here have been gone over by several large numbers of scientists in different ways, looking at mathematical models, behavioral sciences, many other forms of science to find the things which are the most effective. But they also have to be sustainable because this is going to go on for some time. And I think we should not be under any illusions that if we just do this for a couple of weeks, that is sufficient. This is going to have to be prolonged period."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (13:27);Let me start off with the most cheery point about this. For any individual person, the chances of dying from coronavirus are actually very low. Some people will not get the infection, and many of the measures we’re doing at the moment will help with that. Some people will get it and will have no symptoms at all. They won’t even realize they’ve had it. Of those who do have symptoms, the majority will have either a mild disease or a moderate disease, meaning they can easily manage it at home without having to go to the NHS directly or indirectly in any other way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (14:09);But obviously, a small minority, but a significant one, get significant disease requiring hospital care. A small proportion of those will go on to need intensive care. And sadly, some people will go on to die. And as we’ve discussed before, the overall mortality rate looks as if it’s a bit less than 1% on current data, but that’s without knowing how many people get the disease asymptomatically, but we know some people get it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (14:39);Now, we also know that older people are at greater risk, and that is widely known. But it is important, I think, to stress that being old does not necessarily mean you’ll get it worse. And actually, there was a rather nice article by my minister, Nadine Dorries, who actually explained when she had coronavirus, her mother, who caught it from her, had it more mildly. So it’s not a necessary fact that older people will necessarily have it worse."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (15:04);So you might say, “Why, with a disease where we have such small numbers at the moment and which the great majority of people are going to recover from, and most of them will have a mild or non-noticeable disease, would we want to do anything at all?” And the reason is this acceleration. And our overall aim and our single aim is to reduce death rates and the numbers of people who might die as a result of this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (15:31);But I think it’s important to recognize, and the reason I’m explaining this is so people understand the logic of what we’re doing, that there are broadly three groups of deaths and other impacts on health we need to consider. There are the direct deaths, which are caused by the coronavirus disease itself. With good medical care, tragically, a few people, the great majority of them are in less good health but not necessarily all, will pass away."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (16:02);There are, however, and this is really important, a significant number of other deaths which, if the NHS became overwhelmed in any of the four nations, if the intensive care units got to the point when they were overwhelmed, then people would die from indirect deaths because they did not have the ability to get medical care. And a lot of what we are trying to do is trying to reduce the chance that those indirect deaths might occur."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (16:32);And then the third possibility, and it is an important one for us to consider, is that some of the measures we are doing will undoubtedly or could have negative impacts on people’s health themselves. So there are negative effects of what we do to try and combat the coronavirus. One of the reasons we are very keen not to go in advance of need was because of those negative facts, and I’ll come onto one of them later on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (16:58);Now, just to explain where the different things fall into this. The very profound changes in terms of social distancing that the Prime Minister laid out, which are going to be very difficult for people to maintain over a long period of time and will have very significant social effects, do have the capacity significantly to pull down the peak of this infection wave and, therefore, make it easier for the NHS and particularly the ventilation support to be able to cope with the wave that is heading its way. So that is really critical. People who do this, who restrict their social gathering, are doing things to protect the NHS, to allow the NHS to treat both people with coronavirus and people who have other things as well. It has overall effect on the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (17:48);The second group of things which the Prime Minister has laid out are those things that we want the quite large group of people who either are over 70, possibly quite healthy or very healthy over 70, but over 70, or who are younger than 70 but have a significant health condition, and this is mainly in adults, we want them to take even greater care because this is in addition to making sure that they don’t end up helping fuel the epidemic themselves. It means that they do not have to go to hospital, which is good for the NHS. But most importantly, it reduces the risk that they will catch the virus, particularly at a time when the NHS is under strain. This is absolutely critical."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (18:31);And the group of people who we would want to take this advice particularly seriously are older people above 70, people who in adult life would normally be advised to have the flu vaccination, so these are people with chronic diseases such as chronic heart disease or chronic kidney disease, and also as a precautionary measure, because we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure, women who are pregnant. And those three groups …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (19:03);Sure, women who are pregnant, and those three groups are the groups we want to take particular care to minimize their social contact, which will of course will have very significant risks for them. And later on, we will be giving a, I think, very shortly a much more specific list of an even smaller group of people who have very profound health problems. They all know they’ve got very profound health problems. For example, people who might have advanced myeloma or leukemia, things that significantly affects their immune system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (19:35);The final bit that is being talked about today is, in addition to what we’ve previously talked about, is the 14-day stay at home. If one person in the household has symptoms, the whole household stays at home. Now, there has to be some common sense around this. If there’s a very vulnerable person in the household, for example, we’ll need, people will need to take that into account. We’ll need to think, people need to think through the practicalities of their own position, but the reason for this is, because they are helping to stop it be transmitted onto the rest of the community."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (20:12);And these people, the trouble is, if you actually are in a household with someone who’s got coronavirus, there is a reasonably high chance you will be infected, and will go on to get this. So this, is in a sense, some things people are doing to help protect the rest of society."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (20:29);We do want to stress that the great majority of these people will have mild or moderate disease. They don’t need to contact the NHS. They can get, they can use the NHS online service, there’s very sensitive information there. We really would encourage them, not if they have mild or moderate disease, to phone 111, because the service we need to protect, for those who are in greatest need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (20:54);But, really important distress, if anybody’s health starts to deteriorate significantly, then they should phone 111, or contact the health services, in the way they usually would. So this is if people deteriorate, we’d want to make it clear they should then do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (21:12);Finally, I just want to make a point on behalf of my other CMOs, for all four nations. We are enormously proud of what our colleagues in the NHS and public health have done so far to delay this, and to do so in a safe way. An enormous amount of work has gone on to do that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (21:33);The next few weeks and months are going to be extraordinarily difficult for the NHS in all four nations. We know that our colleagues will rise to this challenge, but we know it is going to be very hard, indeed, but we have enormous faith in them. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (21:49);Well, thank you very much Chris. So I want to thank both Chris and Patrick immensely for all the work that they’d been doing over the last, a few weeks and months. And I know it’s a big imposition, but we’re going to walk, we’re going to be making sure that we give daily updates to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (22:05);I do think that would be valuable, so that we can have, as as I said from the beginning, as much transparency as possible, and really try and show our working and our thinking as clearly as possible to the British public. Questions. Now please, Vicki Young, BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Vicki Young: (22:26);Prime minister, looking at these measures. Can I ask you about enforcement? Are you closing theaters, pubs, restaurants down, as of today? And a particular question which we’ve heard at the BBC, lots of questions about care homes. Are you going to stop visitors going into care homes? Lots of people are very concerned about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Vicki Young: (22:44);And then, on a more scientific question about testing, the Director General of the World Health Organization has just said, “A clear message to countries, to test, test, test. You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. Test every suspected case.” Lots of people wondering how you can track the pandemic in this country, if you don’t know who’s got it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (23:05);Yeah, so thanks, Vicki. Well, absolutely, what we’re doing is giving very strong advice that public venues, such as theaters, should no longer be visited. The proprietors of those venues that are taking the logical steps that you’d imagine. You’re seeing the change happen already."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (23:28);As for enforcement, we have the powers, if necessary, but I don’t believe that it will be necessary to use those powers. When it comes to care homes and visitors to care homes, you can take it from what we’ve just said, about avoiding all unnecessary contact for those particular groups."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (23:48);You know, a really strong advice that we’re giving out to people, to avoid unnecessary contact with the over seventies, those with particular health conditions, absolutely. We don’t want to see people unnecessarily visiting care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (24:04);Actually, as to the testing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (24:04);Yes, and on the testing. Yeah, absolutely."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (24:06);Oh, of course, we completely agree with the Secretary General that testing is absolutely critical, and within the UK, we have three levels of testing at the moment. We have testing in intensive care systems, which is across the whole system, as it is a complete surveillance system. We have testing in hospitals for people who got pneumonia, for people who got milder disease, and we have the GP network which is testing in the community. The one thing which we did stop doing was testing based on geography, which was early on, because at this stage geography is much less important in a disease. Now, we do intend to continue to scale up testing, but I think it’s important to realize the scale of UK testing, which has been substantial, and just to give, just some numbers on that, over 44,000 tests conducted, of which 40, over 42,000 were negative."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (24:55);And we will continue to up the testing every single week, from here on in, moving out into the wider community. The test we have at the moment only tests for people who currently got disease. The thing which would be transformational would be a test to reliably tell us if someone has previously had disease, so we can pick up and find out, what proportion of people get this infection without any symptoms. Currently, such a test is not reliable, but it’s being developed very rapidly by public health England."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (25:27);Thanks. Beth Ruby’s going to do something on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Beth Ruby: (25:31);Thank you, Prime Minister. This is quite a big step change from where we were even four days ago, but in other Western European countries, in the US, they’re going further still. There’s states of emergency, cities in forced lockdown, families been asked to stay at home, even if they are not ill, schools closed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Beth Ruby: (25:52);Are these are sorts of measures you think the public should expect in the next few days? And if I may, Sir Patrick, a question for you, you just talked about London, when do you think London will hit the peak? What’s the timeframe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Beth Ruby: (26:06);And in terms of cases of coronavirus across the country now, last week, you said up to 10,000 people last Thursday, how many people now do you think are carrying the virus? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (26:19);Well Beth, just on, on where we are in relation to to others, don’t forget that other countries are at different stages in their movement up the curve. And we’ve always made it very clear that the crucial thing is timeliness. Our interventions should be timely to have the maximum effect. And we think this is the right package for this particular moment, as we start to move up the curve in the way that we’ve said, and as we foreshadowed over the last, over the last couple of weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (26:52);But when you come to more extreme measures, like curfews, and so on and so forth, you’ll see in some of the other countries, we’re keeping all measures under review. And particularly, obviously, people will be thinking about school closures. There is an argument device about school closures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (27:10);We think, at the moment, on balance, it’s much better if we can keep schools open, for all sorts of reasons. But I appreciate this is again something that we need to keep under review."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (27:24);In answer to the question about, where is London on the peak? The important thing is that London is ahead, in terms of reaching that inflection point of actually going into a faster growth phase. Clearly, the measures that have been talked about, are aimed to completely suppress that. And therefore, the peak goes much further out. So this is a sort of slower thing, with a reduced number. That’s what we’re trying to achieve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (27:48);Numbers? Well, the epidemic you’d expect to double every five days or so. So you can work out, there are many more, as from last week, and you can do calculations as to how many you think you may have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (28:02);The absolutely key thing, to reiterate what Chris Whitty has said, is testing, and ramping up our ability to test. And in that, this ability to test who has had the disease, rather than who has just got it now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (28:16);Both of those things are really important, to get a proper handle on this, especially this question of how many people have had it, and been asymptomatic. That is the biggest unknown worldwide, that would completely change all sorts of things, if we can get a handle on that number."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (28:34);Thanks. Robert Peston, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Robert Peston: (28:39);Couple of questions. First, your restrictions on freedom of movement, your urge to families and households to isolate, these are voluntary. They obviously can’t carry great force because they’re coming from the government. Now, in some countries, they have introduced criminal sanctions, if individuals refuse to obey what is effectively a curfew. How likely is it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Robert Peston: (29:08);How prepared are you to introduce criminal sanctions, if necessary? And on this issue of testing. One issue that I hear repeatedly from people in the Health Service, is they are deeply uncomfortable about being forced home if they’ve got a cough, because they’d like to continue to work. Will you, at least for Health Service workers, move fast to allow Health Service Workers to be tested, so that they at least know whether they are a risk to their patients?"

But on powers, actually, Robert, you may be amazed to know that this country already, has government already has tremendous powers in this field."

[crosstalk 00:30:04] But I think most people would accept that we are a mature and grown up and liberal democracy, where people understand, very clearly, the advice that is being given to them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (30:19);And I think they also understand that what we’re saying obviously helps the NHS and helps them. It helps us all as individuals, but it helps the whole community as well. I think the British public do understand that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (30:37);In answer to the question on testing, the next level out, once we have the capacity to do this, which is where we’re really going for very fast, is exactly as you say, that healthcare and indeed other critical workers, that you can actually test them very early on in their illness, if they end up having actually the right symptoms, but in a sense, the wrong disease, or a good disease, and not coronavirus, then they will be able to go back to work, which is good for the NHS, good for society."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (31:08);If they have got it, at least you know they’ve got it, and they’re not going to get it again. And so that, for a positive or a negative, are therefore useful for the service. So there’s a very strong incentive to get this out as fast as we can practically manage it."

I mean, you’ve just announced the most extraordinary measures, saying people shouldn’t go to the pub. They shouldn’t go to cinemas, they shouldn’t go to theaters. What are you going to do to support those businesses, which are looking at the next three months and thinking, “We’re going to collapse if this happens?”"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Jason Gross: (31:42);And Sir Patrick, you’ve told us in this room on Thursday, I think, we were about four weeks behind Italy, we seem to be moving through the gaze extremely rapidly now. Are we? Were you wrong about where we were on that curve last week? Are we further up it, than the scientists thought we were?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (31:59);Well, first of all, Jason, you’re absolutely right. This is going to be a very considerable challenge for businesses, big and small, and we’re going to make sure that we do everything we can to give them the liquidity that they need, make sure that they have the time to pay, but also, make sure in our whole fiscal policy, the way we look at our whole tax and spend system, that we give business the space in which they can come back from this, in which, and I’ve moved out at all, that we’ll be working closely with this. As I said, I don’t, we’ll be working closely with all our partners around the world, to coordinate our response."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (32:44);In response to the question, where are we? At the early stages in outbreak, the numbers are quite small. So actually, the precision with which you can predict exactly where you are is low. And I said that I thought we were perhaps four weeks behind where Italy was. I think the new numbers suggest were maybe more like, three weeks, in terms of that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (33:05);And that’s really why we, and importantly, it looks like we’re on the sort of fast upswing, or just about to get there. And that’s the reason to want to come in quite quickly with these measures."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","George Parker: (33:23);Yeah so, George Parker from the FT. You’re speaking to some of your G7 colleagues, Prime Minister, and you just mentioned the tax and spend issue. Do you think there’s a case for a general global fiscal stimulus, leaving aside specific measures to help struggling businesses? The second question, about the ventilators. How many ventilators do you think you can get into hospitals very quickly, if manufacturers help you, and don’t you regret not having started this process before?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (33:48);First of all, on the fiscal stimulus, I think there’s a widespread agreement amongst colleagues in the G7 that we are going to need to make sure everybody has access to liquidity, and that, if we do things jointly, then I think that the global markets will understand that we’re all already operating in the same sort of fiscal framework, and I think we’ll be much more successful that way. So there’s a lot of work going on that, George."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (34:17);And on the issue of all types of medical equipment, perhaps more like, what I can say is, we’ve talked a lot in these discussions about what we’re doing to flatten the curve, to squash the sombrero, to depress the graph of the growth of the cases. And of course, that’s going on. That’s what we’re doing today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (34:41);But there’s a parallel, a body of work which is equally energetic, which is devoted to making sure that the NHS has all the equipment that it needs. And I can tell you that huge, huge strides are being made right now on delivering ventilators, testing kits, oxygen, everything that we think we’ll need in the weeks ahead. Gordon? Gordon Rayner, please, also."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Gordon Rayner: (35:13);Prime Minister and Sir Patrick, last week, Sir Patrick, in particular, was talking about herd immunity. We’ve heard today of a case in Japan, where somebody has reportedly tested positive twice. Having had it once, they’ve now got it again. Does that mean that herd immunity is now completely out of the window?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Gordon Rayner: (35:33);And Chris Witty was saying just now, I think, that if you test people and they have had the disease, that means they can’t get it again, and they can go back to work. Are you absolutely sure about that, in the light of what we’ve heard today from Japan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (35:47);So don’t-"

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (35:48);I’ll answer the second. So, the first thing, just to reiterate, the objectives, and they’ve always been the objectives, is to make absolutely sure we flatten this curve, keep it below NHS capacity limits. That’s the primary aim, and of course, to make sure that we save lives and protect the vulnerable. That’s what we need to focus on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (36:05);In any infectious disease, there are cases where people can catch something again. They’re rare. There’s nothing to suggest that this is a common occurrence in this disease, but we are learning as we go along. But at the moment there is nothing particularly to suggest that, and we already know, that there are some people who’ve had what are called neutralizing antibodies that have actually stopped it, so that it looks like a normal response to an infection. And there will be occasions, very rare, where somebody might get it more than once, as in any disease, any infectious disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (36:42);So, just to add to that, [inaudible 00:36:43], even in diseases which do not have long lasting immunity, there’s usually a short period of immunity, and that’s enough for a season and it’s an epidemic in the initial phases. So I think it’s important to differentiate between that and long lived immunity. Of course, if people don’t induce very long lived immunity, that makes the idea of a vaccine less certain. So I think we need to be aware of that, and we’ll be watching this very carefully."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (37:10);I think the final thing is, I haven’t seen the details of this report. If people have got immunosuppression or various other things, they can make this more likely, but it’s an involved area."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (37:21);And it’s always worth stressing what, I think we’ve said continuously, which is our objective, our overriding objective, in all cases, is to reduce suffering to minimize the incidence of this disease, and to save life. That’s the the absolute priority."

Which is, right away from the beginning, we described four things, one of which was research. And research is unbelievably important in this, and the UK is outstanding at clinical science and the biological sciences that underpin this. And so, the research in the UK is going to be an important part of tackling this, and part of an important international effort, to make sure that we get on top of this…"

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Tom: (38:10);Thank you, Prime Minister. First of all, can you give the nation any form of indication how long this ban on social contact will last, to prepare them? Should they prepare for a couple of weeks, couple of months, the whole year? Secondly, in terms of effect to the economy, obviously no blame intended, but clearly this has gone far further than the Chancellor might have thought last week, even when he was delivering his budget, which was predestined on 1.1% growth this year. Do you accept now the economy’s not going to grow by 1.1% and the chancellor is going to have to spend an awful lot more public money propping up businesses?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (38:47);Yeah. Just on the timing, I think I might defer to the experts on either side of me. Just on the, on where we are with the economy, it’s perfectly obvious. The G7 conversation I was having today, everybody sees that this is going to be potentially a severe blow for the economy. Everybody can see the risks that this situation poses: the risk to demand, the risk to supply. If we get it right, and if we get the right response, and if we work together, then we can ensure that it is a short term problem because the fundamentals of the UK economy are very strong. This is unlike 2008. There isn’t a systemic problem within the economy. If we can get the disease under control in the way that we’re describing, if we can flatten that peak and it starts eventually to a decline and tells off at the crosswalk, then there’s absolutely no reason why economies worldwide should not come roaring back. It’s a very, very different category of difficulty from 2008. I think people understand that, but on the on timing, Chris?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (40:13);We stressed right from the beginning this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint. I stressed at the beginning of the points I made that sustainability is absolutely critical here. This is not a situation where a couple of weeks and this virus is on the way. Absolutely not. People should be thinking of a minimum of weeks to months and depending how it goes, it may be longer. I think this, it is really important people realize they’re in for the long haul on this, but this is really important. If we’re to defend the ability of the NHS to treat people, if we’re to actually minimize the mortality, we’ve got to see this as a long game."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (40:49);Victoria Donald, channel four."

Just a little while ago, we were told, last week indeed, that it was seven days isolation. Was it that the science moved so much, or that you made a mistake on that? Also, could you tell me about the advice on pregnant women because there have been reports, of course, of babies at the weekend being born and then testing positive, but there have been no reports of in utero transmission?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (41:23);Shall I take the second one and Patrick take the first? In terms of pregnancy, there are reports of, well actually in the global literature at this point in time, one person who became severely ill. We’re very very early in what we know on this, the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which is the professional body, review the evidence. It’s on their website and it was before this case was reported and it makes clear that in the very small number of pregnant women who delivered at or shortly around the time they had this, there were absolutely no complications. T."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (42:03);There are two buts to this. For many infectious diseases, there is a small but appreciable additional risk and we will not know that until a lot more women have had children. We do not know for sure. We can say reliably this is safe or there is some additional risk. Of course, this is a very new virus, so the information we have is relevant to people in the third trimester of pregnancy but not in the earliest stages of pregnancy. I’m maybe giving a long answer because this is something people get very concerned about. There is no evidence from other coronaviruses that makes us feel this is particularly dangerous in the way that for example, the Zika virus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (42:46);Infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general and that is why we’ve taken the very precautionary measure, whilst we try and find out more, to include pregnant women in the group alongside older women and people who’ve got pre-existing significant health conditions. We may in retrospect find that was overkill, but we’d rather be more cautionary now rather than the other way."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (43:11);First thing, to really reiterate what Chris has just said. This is a brand new disease. We need to learn as we go along and that will be part of what we do. The seven days actually isn’t a change. It’s a little bit complicated and I just want to explain it. If you are ill with the symptoms of either new persistent cough or fever, you isolate yourself for seven days. If you lived on your own, that’s what you would do. That’s the advice we gave last week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Patrick Vallance: (43:41);Now we’re saying if anybody in the family gets it or anybody in the household gets it, entire household stays together isolated for 14 days. The reason for that is the other people may pick it up over the seven days or five days period and then they’ve got seven days to have it and get better or to be asymptomatic but have it for seven days. It’s two different periods, but the principle is the same. When you’ve got symptoms, you’re seven days."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (44:10);Have you got that? It’s a difference between individual isolation and household isolation. Heather Stewart?"

You talked there, Prime Minister, about giving businesses the space to deal with this crisis. I wonder whether you think you might need to take more action to give low paid households the space to deal with it. You may now have a situation where couples are both having to take 14 days off work. The budget measures relied on statutory sick paper that’s less than a hundred pounds a week. Do you think you’ll have to do more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (44:42);Well, Heather, we’re doing … We certainly will be bringing forward all the measures that we can. We’re lifting the living wage by a huge amount as you know, and we’re making sure that statute [inaudible 00:44:54] pay and benefits are payable as soon as, as soon as possible. The general principle that’s guiding us, because you’re totally right, we’re going to have to look after people and help them for a considerable period, is it nobody should be penalized for doing the right thing. We hope very much that people listening to this will feel that they can take the measures that we’ve outlined in the knowledge that they will be protected. Sir?"

I think Prime Minister, the Irish government has introduced more aggressive measures on social distancing, including the closure of schools, but the executive in Northern Ireland is following the same pace as the government in the rest of United Kingdom. Are you confident that the people in Northern Ireland are being protected from this virus as effectively as their neighbors in the South?"

Any more that needs to be said?"

Michael [inaudible 00:46:54] from the Herald. It’s really important that you take the public with you in whatever you do, but do you think the UK government needs to try harder to be in lockstep with the Scottish government because any perceived divergence in approach will not reassure the public that there’s a unified approach? I think it was Sir Patrick who said that London was ahead in the outbreak. Do you think, Prime Minister, that Westminster can stay up until July?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (47:25);Well, Michael, look. A very, very good point about what’s going on with all four nations. Actually, if you’d been at the Cobra just now, it was very, very good discussion between us and all the other involved administrations. Everybody’s on the same page. Everybody can see the importance of the measures that we’ve outlined today. On your point about Westminster, we will obviously be wanting to make sure that as I say, the democracy carries on, that we protect our parliamentary institutions, but clearly those who are vulnerable and lots of members of parliament of both houses may come into that category, should receive the protections that they need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (48:17);Prime Minister, I should just add that, just to reassure people. I speak to my counterpart Chief Medical Officers in all four nations very regularly, often several times a day.

Prime Minister, just to follow up on that last point you made, are you suggesting that all parliamentarians, MPS and peers who are over 70 should adhere to today’s announcements? I take it you are, or are they some sort of special category? More importantly, can we be a bit more precise? We’ve had a lot of vague announcements today. You said for example, people in care homes should not be visited, should not be unnecessarily visited. What does “unnecessarily” mean? Secondly, the Chief Medical Officer said that it may be weeks to months that this blanket ban on unnecessary travel and nonessential contact lasts. What do we mean by weeks to months and when we know when it’s over? Will there be an announcement by Public Health England which says, “You can all get back to work,” or what?"

There are no exceptions. Chris, on the precision of the advice for instance, to people visiting care homes?"

I’m not going to go through every single one, because we could spend the rest of the evening just going through one line by line. It is a really difficult area. Let me be clear that how to protect people in care homes and nursing homes is going to be one of the most challenging things for every nation on this this question because, of course, they are vulnerable and they do have to move in and out of health services from time to time and this is not going to be an easy issue anywhere."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (50:51);In terms of the precision of the timing, this will really depend on how the epidemic curve plays out over time, but we’re very confident that the minimum amount of time is going to be quite a number of weeks and it’ll then depend on how it plays out. We’ll obviously be coming back to be much more precise with people about how we feel this is going as time goes by. There’s no point to us, in a sense, putting a crystal ball in front of us and saying for sure to this number of weeks. I just wanted people to feel that this is not a two weeks and we’re done. This is a significant period of time."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Chris Whitty: (51:47);Well, in every country, they’ve tended to be in a sense, what you’d expect as common significant health conditions: significant cardiovascular disease, significant respiratory disease, sometimes people who’ve had significant neurological problems. There are now quite large studies which lay this out in quite granular detail: obviously, the first experience from China where the situation is slightly different from the UK in terms of health services and risks, increasingly sadly, information from Italy. Our own experience here looking at those who sadly have died in this country completely conforms with the international experience."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (52:29);I’m going to wrap it up here. If I may. I know, I’m sorry to those of you haven’t been able to get your questions in, but as I’ve explained, there will be plenty more opportunities in the course of the next few days. Clearly, what we’re announcing today is a very substantial change in the way that we want people to live their lives, and I can’t remember anything like it in my lifetime. I don’t think it’s really been anything like it in peace time. We have to accept that it’s a very considerable psychological behavioral change that we’re asking you, we’re asking the public, the nation to do. I’ve absolutely no doubt that we can do it, that we can do it together. Everybody understands the need to do it. As I said earlier on, that our economy will eventually bounce back because the fundamentals are strong and we will, by doing the measures that we’re doing, by taking the steps that we’re taking, we will ensure that we give our NHS the space it needs and we depress the peak, as I say, in the way that our experts have described."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/boris-johnson-coronavirus-speech-transcript-uk-pm-tells-uk-to-avoid-non-essential-travel-contact","Boris Johnson: (53:37);I have absolutely no doubt that we will also be able in the time that we create, to move a lot further and faster in developing the treatments, the remedies, perhaps even hopefully the vaccines that will enable us to deal with this new coronavirus. Thank you all very much for your patience. I hope everybody has felt that they understood what we’re saying and I’ll see you all tomorrow. Thank you."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a speech today, informing the British people that United Kingdom schools would close indefinitely. Read the full transcript of his full update on COVID-19."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (00:00);I want to tell you where we got to in our national fight back against the coronavirus. Today, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that. I want to repeat that everyone, everyone must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also more importantly to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember, the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough. Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member of that household thinks that he, she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings, pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theaters and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (01:04);Work from home if you can. Wash your hands. And we’ve already announced in the last few days, we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so that we hit 25,000 tests a day. Huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need, we need to protect ourselves and others. We’re asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope with this unprecedented challenge. And we will continue, as we have from the beginning, to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice. And we come today to the key issue of schools, where we’ve been consistently advised that there is an important trade off. And so far the judgment of our advisors has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (02:05);And that’s partly because counterintuitively, schools are actually very safe environments and in this disease and this epidemic, children and young people are much less vulnerable. And hitherto, the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on normal other public services. But I think you’ll agree that I’ve always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we’ve kept under constant review. So looking at the curve of the disease, and looking at why we are now, we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the school. So I can announce today, and Gavin Williamson is making a statement now in the House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils, so the vast majority of pupils, until further notice."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (03:15);And I’ll come to … and I’ll explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils. The objective is to slow the spread of the virus. And as I say, we judge that this is the right moment to do that. But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the rising number of cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work and we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too, from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We’ll be sending out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (04:03);So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children. This will mean that there’ll be of course far fewer children in the schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure that the … as I say, the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (04:38);So we’re simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same. And we’re providing financial support where it’s needed. We’re making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And while some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear that we will reimburse the cost. And of course, this does mean that exams will not take places planned in May and June, though we will make sure that peoples get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (05:20);Now I know that the steps will not be easy for parents or for teachers, and for many parents this will be frustrating and it will make it harder for them to go out to work. And of course that’s one of the reasons that we haven’t wanted to go ahead. And that’s why we are now working on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, outlined yesterday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (05:54);I also need to remind parents, as we’ve already advised, that children should not be left with older grandparents or older relatives who may be particularly vulnerable and fall into some of the vulnerable groups. And I want to … I know that’s going to be difficult too, and I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. And I want to thank the whole country for the efforts that people are making to comply with these measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (06:20);I particularly want to thank teachers, head teachers, all the support staff who keep schools going who are going to be able to make these exceptional arrangements work for the benefit of us all. By looking after the children of key workers, they will be a critical part of our fight back against coronavirus. And as I’ve said, we will take the right steps at the right time guided by the signs. We believe that the steps we’ve already taken, together with those I’m announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease, but we will not hesitate to go further and faster in the days and weeks ahead and we will do whatever it takes so that we beat it together. And I’m now going to pass I think to Patrick to give an update from SAGE’s point of view. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (07:19);Overriding consideration, as always, save lives, protect the most vulnerable people from this illness. The vast majority of people have a mild illness but some get a very severe illness. The measures that were announced a couple of days ago, we already know are taking effect in terms of behavior, so we can see that already, that people are actually taking that very seriously and it made a difference and that’s really important to carry on with that. But the thing we must protect in order to achieve those aims of saving lives and protecting people is to make sure that the NHS intensive care capacity and the ventilator capacity is not breached. That’s what we need to keep looking at and making sure we do not get to a position where that’s breached."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (08:06);As this moves fast, and I alluded to this on Monday, more measures will be needed to make sure that happens. And right from the beginning, we said schools are one of the things you can do, but they’re less important than some of the others that have been taken. But we now think we’re at a stage where this extra bit is an important measure to make sure we stay under that critical protecting NHS, ICU, and ventilator capacity. So that’s the reason for now saying that this should go ahead at this time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (08:38);It’s important to stress, and this is really critical, it’s not because schools are dangerous places for children. They’re not. Children have a very mild or asymptomatic version of this disease in many cases. So they are the least at risk. It’s also not a dangerous place for teachers. The reason for this is because of the effect it can have just to knock down further the transmission … put some delay into the system, put some breaks into the system of the transmission of this disease to bring it down to protect those people who might get the much more serious version and end up in intensive care or on a ventilator."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (09:22);So that’s the reason. Now is the important time to do it. It’s not instead of, and it can’t supplement the other measures. The other measures are crucially important and we all have our part to play to make sure that we make those measures as effective as possible to try to drive this right down and make sure we stay below that critical threshold. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (09:44);Thanks so much, Patrick. Jenney, from your point of view."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Jenney Harries: (09:47);So I think nothing very much further to add to those points. So exactly as Patrick explained, this is not a change in the scientific position, which we’ve always taken forward. It is very much a practical response at a critical time as both the Prime Minister and Sir Patrick has indicated, but very happy to …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Jenney Harries: (10:03);… as both the Prime Minister and Sir Patrick has indicated, but very happy to answer any clinical questions that come up."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (10:06);Okay, excellent. Well, thank you very much, Jenney. Let’s go straight to to you for your questions on this. Beth Rigby, Sky News."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Beth Rigby: (10:17);Thank you. Prime Minister, just in terms of further measures, a third of the deaths are now in the capital of London. Buses are still full, the tubes are full, bars are full. London is not listening to your advice. You’ve shot the schools today. When will we see wider enforcement to shut down London properly? And if I may, just on the antibodies test. After quite difficult days and frightening news, something a bit more encouraging today, you talked about getting closer to an antibodies test to tell us whether people have had the virus. When will it be ready, and what sort of impact could it have? Could it be a game changer in helping us manage this disease and keeping our emergency services running? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (11:05);Yeah. Well Beth, thank you very much. And look, we’ve always said that we’re going to do the right measures at the right time. That’s what we’ve done and actually I think a lot of people are making a real heroic effort to comply with the advice that we’ve given. But as I said tonight and in past few days, we keep everything under continuous review and we will not hesitate to bring forward further and faster measures where we think that is necessary. But on the antibodies…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (11:38);So two types of tests are important. The test that say have you got the active virus and that’s being rapidly scaled up by Public Health England and that’s [inaudible 00:01:47] actively got it at the moment. The second one as you allude to is the antibody test, which tells you whether you’ve had it and whether you’ve now got antibodies against it and that’s progressing very fast. Public Health England are looking at this today and they’ve got a test which they’ve got in house that they’re going and we’re looking at ways to get a much more widespread version of that out. It is a game changer and the reason it’s a game changer is that it allows you to understand the proportion of the asymptomatic population. Who’s had this disease but hasn’t had symptoms that are in any way significant? And we don’t have that number accurately for anywhere in the world at the moment. So if we can get that number, it starts to really help. In going forward, it’s going to be critically important to be able to monitor this disease well because only by being able to monitor it can we start relaxing measures again, start understanding what the effect of taking things off again at some point is. So this is all part of a critical ability to manage this as an agile way going forward."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (12:53);Jenney, I think you had a little on that as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Jenney Harries: (12:56);Well, just to say that I think exactly as Sir Patrick has said,it is actually not just our health workforce, it’s our care workforce as well. And the other measures that we’ve introduced particularly to protect the vulnerable when we have a matched workforce, if you like, where we’re clearly aware of their antibody status, whether they have had the disease and are therefore safe to work with our vulnerable group, that increases our opportunities around our interventions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (13:19);And everybody can see the immense advantages. The thing about this disease, it’s an invisible enemy and we don’t know who’s transmitting it, but the great thing about having a test to see whether you’ve had it or not is suddenly a green light goes on above your head. You can go back to work safe and confident in the knowledge that you’re most unlikely to get it again. So from an economic point of view, from a social point of view, as Sir Patrick says, it really could be a game changer. It’s important not to get ahead of ourselves. We’re not there. We’re not there yet. But you really can see the potential of that advance, which is, as I say, coming down the track. Let’s go to Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Laura Kuenssberg: (14:02);Thank you very much, Prime Minister. You were very eager to avoid closing schools if you possibly could, but now you have taken that decision. Families will wonder maybe more than anything else tonight how long these closures might last. Can you give us any indication? The Scottish government has suggested maybe six months until the summer holidays. And to the medics, if I may, you have touched on this, Sir Patrick, but in the simplest clearest of terms, if schools are to be closed to slow the spread, why are they safe places for any child or any member of staff?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (14:36);Well, on the duration, Laura, obviously we’re going to try to keep it to an absolute minimum as you can imagine, to keep it [inaudible 00:14:44] and get things going as fast as we can. But our judgment right now is that this is the moment to provide further downward pressure, as I say, on the upwards trajectory of the virus by taking that step for epidemiological reasons alone whilst doing what we can, as I said, to protect our ability to keep the NHS going by delivering care and education for key workers. We think this is the right moment to do it. I wish I could give you the answer about how long it will be, Laura, but we’ve got to do it right now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (15:22);So two sets of measures, one are about making sure all of us are protected, which is about reducing transmission. Second is about protecting those people most at risk. This falls into the category of the first. It’s about making sure that we stop transmission, reduce transmission, and children are not getting a serious form of this illness. They are very mild, often asymptomatic, and therefore don’t have a big risk around each other. They also may not spread it as much. We don’t know that yet. We don’t know the exact spread of this. It’s not like influenza. That seems to be clearer, but we don’t know exactly how that works, so this is about a measure to protect all of us. It’s not a measure because there’s some specific risk to children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (16:10);Thanks. Jenney, anything you want to add on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Jenney Harries: (16:12);Just to say that obviously the whole approach is to reduce the social contact throughout society and we have taken the measures which maximize the impact to health and our safety whilst minimizing those to the way that we live. This measure moves that on a small amount as we’ve said, but is, as Sir Patrick said, this not to do with the the safety of the children. It’s simply about a background level of the numbers of social contacts that we have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (16:41);Thanks. Shehab Khan, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Shehab Khan: (16:43);Prime Minister, you mentioned that exams will now be canceled. There will be plenty of students who are about and preparing to take their GCSEs and A-levels. Their college, six form places, their university places and job offers will be contingent on those exams. What measures are you taking on that? Also, if I may, you mentioned you want to increase the number of tests to 25,000 a day. Will people still need to go to hospital to take those tests especially if they’re not showing symptoms? What do you advise people to do?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (17:14);Okay. Well, Shehab, thank you very much. First of all, on exams and on the ambitions, the hopes of students, pupils in our schools, I totally understand people’s frustrations, the frustrations of parents who are going to feel now that they have to to stay at home. And as I said earlier, we’re going to make sure that we look after workers of all kinds. But when it comes to kids and their exam qualifications, we will make sure that they are not impeded, their progress is not impeded as a result of the decisions we’re having to take now about their schools. So we will make sure that in time they get the qualifications they need. I don’t want to go in detail about when and how those qualifications will be administered, but it will be done fairly and in order to protect their interests."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (18:03);Do-"

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (18:04);On testing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (18:05);I think that’s a very good question about where … Shehab asked about where the testing would take place and I mean I think there’s a lot of progress we’re going to be making on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (18:16);There’s a lot of … I mean, at the moment the testing is about people in hospital with respiratory illness, people in intensive care units. It’s about outbreaks in an area and it’s about making sure that we can test those who are most vulnerable or need particular protection. Now as you get more tests, of course you can roll out more people under those categories. And it’s important that we don’t end up with everyone coming to a hospital to be tested for all the reasons we’ve talked about before. So as the increase in capacity comes on line, there will be ways of testing which don’t require people to go to hospital. I don’t know, Jenney, if you want to say anything more about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Jenney Harries: (18:54);Yeah, so obviously that reflects I think the position that we’re in at the moment. We’ve steeped up our current testing capacity moving towards 25,000 today. And another group in that is very much as we start putting on the question that Beth raised earlier is about actually acknowledging that we need to retain and know that we are using safe clinical staff so that’s another group … Excuse me. But as we go forward we will be very much have an ambition to have some sort of home-based test for the very reason which has been described here, which is we don’t want potentially infectious people arriving in hospitals, but we recognize that the public and particularly our key workers want to understand their health status so that they can get back to normal activities. So a lot of work on that ongoing and I think huge progress made in the last few weeks."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (20:09);Well, Jim, thanks very much. As the chancellor said yesterday, we’re going to, he outlined a big package of 330 billion pounds by which the government will stand behind companies as they go through this tough time, stand behind their lenders, make sure that we keep their lenders going, and there is always a big package, as you know, about 20 billion to support business directly, in cash terms, 25 thousand grants for SMEs, 10 thousand for the smallest businesses, but your point is a good one and we will continue to look at the steps that may be necessary to support good companies that are now facing difficulties through no fault of their own, and we certainly will be doing whatever it takes to help those companies through tough times, because I’m absolutely convinced that the UK economy will come back, will come back very strongly, and when it does we want those companies to be in the best possible position to take advantage."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (21:59);Absolutely. Thanks, Heather, and as I said in the House this morning, we will be bringing forward legislation which will help renters, prevent them from suffering no fault eviction, that kind of thing. We will want to protect people who face difficulties, as I said, through no fault of their own. We can not penalize people for doing the right thing, nor can we penalize people when you have an economic upset that is the direct result of the governments actions, the government’s advice, which are intended to protect the public. Everybody who experiences that kind of dislocation, that kind of disruption is entitled, as I said yesterday, to protection and support, and that’s what we will provide."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (22:51);Wow, you’ve got a lot of questions here. Okay, Tom?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Tom: (22:56);Tom [inaudible 00:00:22:55]. Thank you, Prime Minister. On the closing of the schools, can you say is this a mandatory thing you are doing? Are they-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (23:02);Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Tom: (23:02);Will they be required by law to do this, and what about the schools that have already closed, will they be required to reopen if, to teach the key workers you just [crosstalk 00:23:11]?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (23:10);Yes, [crosstalk 00:23:13]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Tom: (23:11);I’m very sorry, a very, very quick secondary one. The Brexit transition period, the country clearly wants you to focus on dealing with the credit crisis, what you are doing, will you rule out extending the transition period here now or might that be something you want to consider in the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (23:27);Tom, first of all on schools, clearly the government is, will be closing the schools, and we have the power to do that. When it comes to private schools, we have, I believe we have the same powers. Obviously, we will work to ensure that [inaudible 00:23:48] and so forth are properly compensated. And as for the provision for … And nurseries are properly compensated. As for the provision for the vulnerable and for the key workers in the schools that have already closed, we will work to ensure that they, where necessary, they provide those facilities as well as other schools."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (24:12);I think what you possible need to imagine is that as we go down the track, since there will only be a minority, a small minority of pupils going forward in the future who are being continuously looked after by schools, there may be an overall reduction in the number of schools who are providing any type of service at all, if you see what I’m saying? There may be some rationalization so that not every school is providing the service for key workers and for the vulnerable, if you see what, but that’s, on Monday what we want, if possible, is for all children in those sectors still to go to their schools. If you’re in those groups, to, still to go to their schools, if you see what I’m saying. So on Monday, just to clarify that, it’s important that children of key workers, pupils of key worker parents, and we’ll be identifying those groups, we’ll be sending out more in, very, very shortly, those pupils should turn up to their school, and vulnerable kids, vulnerable pupils as well. I hope that’s clear."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (25:28);And you had another question, what was it about?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Tom: (25:30);[crosstalk 00:25:33]-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (25:31);It was another subject, what was it? It was a subject that’s been banished, it’s been done."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Tom: (25:35);[crosstalk 00:25:36]-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (25:37);It’s been, it’s been … I feel, it’s not a subject that’s being regularly discussed, I can tell you in Downey Street at the moment, and we’re getting on with, there are, legislation, there’s legislation in place that I have no intention of changing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (25:56);Hugo Guy from inews."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Hugo Guy: (26:00);Thank you, Prime Minister. Following on from Beth’s question, is there any intention to bring in legal restrictions on when, where or how people can travel around, whether that’s specifically in London or more broadly?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (26:16);Well, thanks Hugo. We live in a land of liberty, as you know, and it’s one of the great features of our lives that we don’t tend to impose those sorts of restrictions on people in this country, but I have to tell you we will rule nothing out, and we will certainly wish to consider bringing forward further and faster measures where that is necessary to suppress the peak of the epidemic, to protect our NHS, to minimize casualties and to minimize suffering. That is our objective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (26:54);Anyone? I don’t know. Okay, thank you. Okay, this is the last question I’m afraid for this round, folks, but there are going to be more of these sessions, as you know. So the last question goes to Charlotte Ivers of Talk Radio."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Charlotte Ivers: (27:08);Thank you, Prime Minister. Sir Patrick, it appears people are quite reluctant to follow this advice, as Beth mentioned earlier. Can I ask if you’re modeling of the results takes that into account? And secondly, Prime Minister, how would you describe the people who aren’t taking the advice on social distancing? Are they being immoral?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (27:28);No. Well, I’ll ask Patrick to answer first, but, go."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Patrick Vallance: (27:32);So the modeling does take into account that not everyone’s going to follow it, but a very high proportion need to, and that means we all need to really focus on this, because the moment we say “Well, it’s not for me, it’s for somebody else” and the compliance of this goes down, the less effective it’s going to be, and the reason this is important, I can’t stress this enough, is to make sure that the NHS ICU capacity is kept in a way that we don’t breach it and the ventilators are available to do this. So when we don’t adhere to this, we’re actually putting lots of people at risk. We’re putting those sickest patients at risk, and so it’s crucial that this isn’t taken as soft advice, but is taken as a really clear instruction to do this if we’re going to make sure that we protect the lives of others."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (28:27);Anything you want to say on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-boris-johnson-says-uk-schools-will-close-indefinitely-due-to-coronavirus","Boris Johnson: (28:28);Well look, I just want, I want to wrap up by answering your question, because it’s a very profound and important question, Charlotte, and of course people must take their own decisions, and I’m a believer, as I said, in freedom, but there’s been absolutely no doubt that these are very, very important choices that we’re now making in our daily lives, and the more closely and the more strictly, the more ruthlessly we can enforce upon ourselves and our families the advice that we’re getting about avoiding unnecessary gatherings, about staying at home when we have symptoms, all that advice, which is good advice, then the better we will be able to protect our NHS, the fewer deaths we will have, and the less suffering there will be in the UK population, and the faster we will get through this and the better we will bounce back eventually. So it is a very, very clear choice for people. This is strong, strong advice, and I say, and to get back to Beth’s initial question, absolutely, we do not rule out, because it would be quite wrong to do so, we do not rule out taking further and faster measures in due course."
