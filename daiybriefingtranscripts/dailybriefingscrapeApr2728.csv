"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (00:00);And by deputy chief scientific advisor, Angela McLean. This morning at 11:00 o’clock, we paused to remember the 85 NHS colleagues and the 19 colleagues from social care who’ve lost their lives with coronavirus. It was a solemn moment of reflection for so many of us, and of unbearable sadness for some. These are the nation’s fallen heroes and we will remember them. Every day we’re working through our plan to protect life and to protect the NHS, slowing the spread and building capacity so that the NHS, at all times, can offer the very best care to everybody because we’ve got the beds and the ventilators and the staff available."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (00:53);So far, thanks to the incredible work of NHS colleagues and the shared sacrifice of everyone who’s at home, that plan is working. The latest figure show 3,260 spare critical care beds across the NHS. On the most recent figures, there’ve been 763,387 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 43,453 yesterday. 161, 145 people have tested positive, an increase of 3,996. 15,796 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. 21,678 have now sadly died in hospital, an increase of 586 since yesterday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (01:54);This morning, the office for national statistics and the CQC published more information on the overall impact, including that there have been 4,343 notified deaths in care homes since Easter. The proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is around a sixth of the total, which is just below what we see in normal times. I want to make sure that we bring as much transparency as possible to important information like this. And so from tomorrow, we’ll be publishing not just the number of deaths in hospital each day, but the number of deaths in care homes and in the community too. This is something that wasn’t previously possible. This will supplement the ONS and CQC weekly publication and all add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day, and it’ll help inform the judgements that we make as we work to keep people safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (02:59);Behind every single death is a family’s heartbreak, and we must do everything humanly possible to save as many lives as we can. We will not be changing the social distancing rules until our five tests have been met, the NHS protected, infection rates falling, the number of deaths falling substantially, the operational challenges around testing and PPE addressed and no risk of a second spike."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (03:32);I want to update you on two other issues of major importance. First on testing. At the start of the month, I set a goal of 100,000 tests a day. Every day, we’re ramping up this testing capacity on track to meet that goal. We’re continuously opening new drive-through centers. There are now 41 with 48 going live this week. For people who can’t get to the tests, we’re expanding home testing to bring the test to them. We’re increasing the dispatch of home test kits from 5,000 a day last Friday to 25,000 a day by the end of the week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (04:12);At the weekend, 17 mobile testing units, manned by the army, were operational. By the end of the week, we plan to have over 70 deployed with trained crews right across the country. All of this has led to an increase in daily testing capacity, which now stands at 73,400, and this has allowed us progressively to expand access to testing. We started with hospital patients who’ve always have the access to tests right away through ramping up to include symptomatic NHS and social care colleagues and their households and then to all essential workers. Today, because we’ve been able to expand capacity, I can expand access further."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (05:04);Building on successful pilots, we’ll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS. This will mean that anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test whether they have symptoms or not. I’m determined to do everything I can to protect the most vulnerable and we now have the capacity to go further still. So from now, we’re making testing available to all over 65s and their households with symptoms and to all workers who would have to leave home in order to go to work and members of their households, again, who have symptoms. So from construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing. The expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe and it’s possible because we’ve expanded capacity for testing thus far."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (06:20);Next, I want to update you on our COVID-19 therapeutics work. This is research to understand whether existing drugs could be used to treat people more effectively once they’ve developed the disease. Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat COVID-19, but our therapeutics task force has identified a number of promising candidates. Currently, six different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials, and the first is ready to enter the next stage, a new early phase clinical trial platform that we’re launching today. This is a national effort made possible by government, academia, and industry all working together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (07:01);In addition, we have to make the best possible use of all the medicines that we have. We’re updating the guidelines for the use of medicines in care homes, removing a barrier so that for the period of the pandemic, where it’s clinically appropriate, medicines that have been labeled for use by one patient can be used by another patient who needs them instead of being destroyed. Clinicians and colleagues in social care have called for this change and it’s already standard procedure in hospitals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (07:32);Right across government, we’re working day and night to defeat this virus, ramping up testing capacity, investigating new drugs and treatments, backing vaccine development, securing and distributing billions of items of PPE, getting the NHS whatever resources it needs to make sure that it is always there to treat everybody who needs it. The risk of a second peak is real, but as a nation, we’re holding it at bay. So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’m now going to turn to the deputy chief scientific advisor to take us through the daily charts. Angela."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (08:15);Thank you very much. If I could have the first slide please. I wanted to go into a bit more detail about the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. So the first of those is that the NHS shall have sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The second is that we should have seen a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from coronavirus. Number three says that we must have reliable data to show us that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. Fourth is that operational challenges, including testing and PPE, are in hand with supply able to meet future demand. And the fifth test is that we must be confident that any adjustments that we make to our current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (09:23);And if I could just have the next slide please, here is a description of transport use and how it has changed across Great Britain for a number of different ways of traveling. And it starts on the 16th of March on the left hand side and runs to Saturday, 26th of April. And what you see when you look at this data is how volumes of all kinds of traffic have fallen relative to how much travel there was in the first week of February. So in particular, we remain pleased to see that the use of public transport is below 20% for buses, the tube and national rail. And we just very much hope that all those people in motor vehicles who are not below 20% are practicing really excellent social distancing when they get it wherever it is that they’re going."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (10:22);Next slide please. We know that it’s been a lot of work for everybody, and this slide is new cases in UK between the 21st of March and the 28th of April. And what it shows is that that … So this is new positive tests. In dark blue is tests that happened in hospitals and in orange is additional testing that has become available for key workers. And what you see in that slide is how that number of positive tests rose very quickly through the latter part of March and has now stabilized. And the blue line, the numbers in hospital positive tests, is starting to fall, although because of the number of tests is still rising overall, we’re still getting about the same number of positive tests across the UK. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (11:26);This instead of counting test counts people. So this is people who are in hospital with COVID-19 again across the UK. And what you see is that overall, that has fallen by 14% in the last … I think it’s in the last week. Sorry, I’m looking for a date. It’s yes. Over the last week, that has fallen by 14%, particularly a dramatic fall in [inaudible 00:11:55] peaked early compared with the rest of the country, and several other regions of England now are clearly falling, although a few regions of England, that number of people in hospital, is still stable for now. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (12:15);This is critical care beds in which there is a patient with COVID-19. So this is two kinds of critical care beds, those in the high dependency wards and those in intensive care wards. And the four different lines are England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. And what you see is what percentage of those beds that can be used for critical care are occupied by a patient with COVID-19. Again, what you see is across all four nations, that has peaked and is beginning to fall as a percentage. Next slide please. We have to turn to how many people have died from COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (13:03);We have to turn to how many people have died from COVID. And our first way of counting that is daily COVID-19 deaths in hospital. So this is a slide that many of us would be familiar with. It’s the way we have been counting for more than a month now. When you look at that slide, the first thing you see is this, well, I guess the first thing you see is that the number of deaths in hospital has started to fall. It’s been falling for the last two weeks. You see that most easily by looking at the orange line. The orange line is a seven day rolling average. And the reason we use that is that there are these very strong weekend effects in these data. So what you see is that out of every seven days, there are always two days when it’s really low, followed by a day when it’s much higher. Because today is Tuesday, it’s higher today. Because on a Tuesday, we report results from a few days ago. I think the most important thing to see there is that the orange line is falling steadily. But this is just one of the ways that we can count how many people have died with COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (14:11);Next slide please. This is a different way of counting the same thing. So this is all weekly registered deaths from COVID-19 across the UK compared with what I just showed you, the deaths in hospital. So let’s just look at the last bar, which is for the week leading up to the 17th of April. The dark blue bar is what we just looked at but summed up up to then. Whereas the pale blue bar is all weekly registered deaths. So that’s everybody, not just the people who died with COVID in hospital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (14:47);If I could have the next slide, please. So what the next slide does is it takes the pale blue line that we just had and breaks it out into a number of different locations. So what you see is hospital is the right hand bar in a sort of smoky blue. Just the left of that is people who died with COVID in care homes. Just below that is people who died with COVID in their own home. And then the smallest bar is other locations. So what you can see here is that deaths from COVID are dominated by those deaths in hospital, but that is not the only location in which such deaths are seen. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (15:41);The last slide for today compares UK deaths with those in other nations. So these lines are lined up against the first day when there had been a total of 50 deaths accumulated in each of these nations. And we have two different lines on there describing what’s happened in the UK. Towards the right hand side, you see a dark blue line labeled UK hospitals only. And that’s the data that we’ve been collecting and showing for a long time. So it’s people who have died with COVID in UK hospitals. Whereas a gray line further over to the left there is people who have died with COVID in the UK in all settings. And not surprisingly, if you count all settings, that line is higher than the people who died in UK hospitals. That’s the end of the data for today. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (16:39);Thanks very much, indeed. As with yesterday. We’re now going to take questions from the public before turning to journalists. And the first, we’re going to take two questions today from the public. These are questions that, as with the questions from journalists, we don’t see an advance. The first I’ll read out from the screen and then the second is going to be relayed by video. So the first question is from Amanda from Hull and she asks, given that grandparents can not be used as childcare, what is the plan for easing the lockdown for full time working parents who have young children that may not be allowed to be in school on a full time basis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (17:23);And Amanda, this is a really good question. And the honest answer I can give you is that it is still too early to say when we’re going to be able to get schools to go back because there are still too many deaths each day. And the five tests that we set out haven’t been met. Now I know, especially as a father of three young children, that there’s a yearning from people to know when schools might go back. And of course it’s something that we think about and we talk about. And I’m sorry that I can’t give you a more definitive answer, but I can’t because we don’t yet have the number of deaths and the number of infections low enough for that to be safe to reopen the schools and we don’t yet know how fast the number of new cases will fall. And so we haven’t been able to make that decision yet. Angela, I don’t know if you want to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (18:29);I’m not sure I do have anything to add on that. We are, of course, all of us, yearning for the number of deaths each day to fall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (18:38);Thank you, Amanda. Thank you for your question. And all I can say is that I hope we can be in a position to be able to give a definitive answer as soon as possible. And the best way to get there is for people, everybody watching, to stay at home in order to protect the NHS, to save lives, and to bring that curve down. Thank you, Amanda. Next question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Sadie: (19:03);Hi. My question is regarding my 10 year old son who has cystic fibrosis and autism. Apart from shielding, is there any other option for him and others in the extremely vulnerable category to return to school and be part of society again without a vaccine available?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (19:20);Thank you, Sadie. The answer to this is yes. We have made sure, in the school’s policy, that we’re working very hard to ensure that those who have extra needs, for instance, people with autism and cystic fibrosis, get that extra support. It is, of course, very, very hard though when that clashes with the medical needs which have to come first. And for those who are in the shielded category, I’m afraid that the safest thing for them to do is to be shielded, which is not just to stay at home, but really be protected from all contact because of the consequences should they get the disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (20:08);Yes. I think I agree. That’s right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (20:11);Thank you very much and thank you for your question. And of course, you mentioned a vaccine and we’re all working incredibly hard to try to get a vaccine as soon as possible. But again, the science behind that is uncertain and so the timings are uncertain. And thank you very much for those two questions from the public. I think that this is working well, having questions from members of the public. I’m very grateful to all those who have submitted and it’s something that we’re going to keep on doing. So thanks very much. And now we’ll turn to Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (20:46);Thank you very much. I wanted to raise the subject of PPE. I know it’s been discussed several times at this occasion before, but it’s still a talking point after Panorama and also a survey of doctors suggesting some are of concern still. What assurances can you give front line staff that there will be adequate supplies of PPE in the days and weeks ahead?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (21:08);Well, thank you, Hugh. The issue of PPE is incredibly important and making sure that there are the supplies of PPE so that everybody on the front line has the PPE and the protective equipment that they need. As you know, we’ve been moving heaven and earth to get the amount of PPE that we need to the frontline, both buying it from abroad and also then distributing it. That system is getting stronger all of the time, but it is a mammoth effort to do it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (21:44);I saw two of the things that you referred to, I’m not sure that they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation, but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the front line and we we take full responsibility to getting it to every single person who needs it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (22:08);Can I ask a quick follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (22:08);Yes, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (22:10);Can you assure staff that stocks are not running low at the moment?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (22:16);Well, I can assure staff that the PPE that we need according to the agreed guidelines, that is available. We’re constantly needing to buy more from abroad and to make more at home to make sure we’re constantly replenishing that. And that’s a huge effort. Globally, there’s a shortage of PPE because the demand for PPE, understandably, in so many countries has shot up. And therefore, we’re out buying it around the rest of the world. And I’m really glad that a whole host of factories here in the UK are turning over their production towards PPE. It’s incredibly important. It’s a huge amount of effort. And we’re working on it as hard as we possibly can. Thanks, Hugh. Paul Brand from ITV. We’ve lost your audio, Paul."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (23:18);Hopefully you can hear me now, Secretary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (23:19);Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (23:20);Excellent. Given today’s statistics, Health Secretary, do you now recognize that while you’ve prevented the NHS from becoming overwhelmed, there is now a crisis in the care sector? And given that the number of deaths continues to go up in care homes each day, will it now be your main priority?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (23:38);Well, of course care homes have been a top priority right from the start. We put out our first guidance to care homes in February and we’ve been working with them throughout. Now, by their nature, care homes look after and support some of the most vulnerable people anyway. And they support some of the people who are most vulnerable to this disease as well because of the nature of the disease and how it impacts on, especially on older people much more than the rest of the population. So it’s been a focus from the start. We’ve strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and improved infection control. And also making testing available throughout the care sector I think is incredibly important as we’ve ramped up the availability of testing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (24:36);We keep a close eye on it and I’m very glad that we’re now able to publish these daily data, which will keep the focus on what’s happening in care homes. I asked for that to start and I think we talked about it a week or so ago and now we’ve got those data being collected so that we can focus on it day in, day out. And my principle in this is to be as transparent as possible because then you find problems as quickly as possible. And we-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (25:07);You say that you’ll keep an eye on it, but carers are frustrated. And I understand this is a complex sector. There’s lots of private providers here. It’s not like the NHS. And that’s a fair point that you have often made. But given that the number of deaths in care homes continues to go up every day, surely this has to be your first priority now. This looks as though this is where the virus continues to spread."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (25:29);The spread of the virus through care homes is absolutely a top priority, yes. And on the testing, I think John Newton wanted to add something."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (25:36);Well, yes. I mean, it is absolutely right that care homes are a focus. And in fact, we’ve done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. And what that showed was that the presence of symptoms was not a very good marker in the care home setting, both amongst residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. So there were significant numbers of residents who were asymptomatic who had the virus. And so we’ve massively increased the amount of testing available. So we’ve now tested 25,000."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (26:03);The amount of testing available. So we’ve now tested 25,000 residents in care homes and we’re rolling out testing now to symptomatic and asymptomatic residents as well as providing testing through the drive incentives and through the other means that Secretary of State’s mentioned for staff. And we think that will really make a difference combined with intensive infection control methods informed by much more widely available testing. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (26:26);Thanks, John. Nick Martin from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (26:31);Very good afternoon. A question for all of you, but the health secretary first. I just want to clarify something you said in your introduction, Secretary of State. You said the proportion of corona deaths in care homes is around the sixth of the total. In week 16, which I think is ending April the 17th, care home deaths were actually 23% of the official COVID deaths. And of total deaths, not just COVID, closer to a third. Are you saying that the number of people who’ve died in care homes during this crisis is around in line with the number of deaths you would normally see in any other year?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (27:06);No, I’m absolutely not saying that latter point. What I was saying very clearly is that, in the statistics that have been published so far, the number of deaths from coronavirus in care homes is around a sixth in total. But of course the breakdown of the statistics, exactly as you say, shows that that proportion is changing and we’ve got to… So, I was putting it in the broad context, but also saying that it is an absolute focus of ours because it’s an area which you’ve highlighted many times in the past under an area where we’ve got a huge amount of focus. Thanks. Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (27:59);Could I just have a followup please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:00);Yes, of course. Of course, Nick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (28:02);I’m so sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:03);No problem."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (28:04);A lot of people have died in care homes. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. And you knew and your department knew that this was a high risk area. You have a huge guidance to care homes repeatedly over the last few months, and yet PP was inadequate, tests for the most part were few and far between, but yet the deaths in care homes seem to take you and your department by surprise. And this isn’t meant to be a clever, catch you out question at all, but I wonder if you will take this opportunity to apologize to those families of loved ones who died in care homes because the government didn’t properly protect them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:45);The thing is, Nick, I think that’s unreasonable as a question, actually. And I know you care an awful lot about this, but, from the start, we know, we knew that there was a very significant challenge with care homes, not least because of the frailty of the residents and the enormous work that’s gone on within government, Public Health England, and local authorities, and the CQC to monitor this from the start. It has been more difficult to get data flowing, and I’m very glad we’re able to do that now on a daily basis instead of a weekly basis as before, and making sure that care homes have the support they need has been absolutely at front of mind right from the start."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (29:36);In fact, I can remember in one of the very early discussions about coronavirus in January, having a discussion about, because one of the first things we knew about this virus was that it had a very strong age profile, as in it was much more dangerous for older people. That immediately drew our attention to the fact that there was a big challenge in care homes, especially because people are more frail, and therefore they are more at risk. It’s something that we focused on right from the start and something that’s been a huge challenge throughout, and we’re constantly learning from what happens and trying to improve the way that we support people across the care sector."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (30:23);Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (30:25);Secretary of State, why didn’t you bring in tests earlier? It just seems odd that it took a while for tests to come through. If you knew the risks and, as you just clearly said, why did it take you so long to give the sector what it was crying out for, and that was tests?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (30:41);Well, we have been testing in care homes right from the start and throughout the crisis. So that’s one of the things in your question that I dispute, and I know the passion that you have for this subject. But it is really important to base, for us to explain what’s been going on and we’ve been testing right from the start. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:02);It’s important to understand that, from the word go, Public Health England has been investigating any outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes. And the approach there would be to test a limited number, when test capacity was limited, we’re talking about beginning of April, test capacity was limited to test a number of index cases to clarify that it was an outbreak of coronavirus. Then the whole care home would be treated as if the symptomatic cases were all coronavirus and various measures were put in place, and no doubt many lives saved as a result."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:33);Obviously, now we have more testing and we have more knowledge about the way the virus spreads in care homes. We’re able to adapt that and we’ll be even more effective. But it would be wrong to say that testing was not available and not used. And it would also be wrong to say that nothing was done about these outbreaks. A great deal was done, but we’re confident we can be more effective now than in the past."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:52);The issue of care homes is an international one. Every country in Europe has had a significant problem with a large proportion of the deaths from coronavirus occurring in the care home sector. We are no different in that respect. And the care home sector is a highly distributed system. It’s intrinsically difficult to deliver services to that sector. But nevertheless, a huge effort has been made in collaboration with organizations like the Care Quality Commission and also local government. So a lot has been done. We all want to do more and we are, certainly with testing, we’re going to be able to do a lot more with this additional capacity that Secretary of State described. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (32:29);Thanks, Nick. Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Ben Kentish: (32:33);Thank you. Good afternoon to you all. Secretary of State, I know you’ve said you’re following the science on this, but it’s been almost a week since your scientific advisors made a new recommendation in relation to the use of face masks, Scotland today becoming the latest country to recommend they are used in public places. Are you able to tell us about the deliberations you’re making on that, what the delay is, and when we’re likely to hear some sorts of ruling, some sorts of advice on that? And if I could also ask very quickly to Professor McLean another practical question. Experts in some countries have given very clear advice about stopping the spread of this disease from surfaces. I know you’ve recommended washing hands. But other countries, for example, are saying people should be disinfecting their washing, takeaway boxes, anything really coming into their house. Are you recommending British people do those sorts of things too? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (33:24);They’re all questions to Professor McLean. What I’d say is that, on face masks, we are guided by the science, and the government position hasn’t changed. Professor McLean will explain the science. The UK Government position hasn’t changed, not least because this most important thing people can do is the social distancing as opposed to the weak science on face masks. There is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it. So that is our absolute priority in terms of the message to the public, that the social distancing, staying at home is the thing that is helping to save lives by flattening the curve. That is the number one thing. Professor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Professor McLean: (34:12);The recommendation from SAGE is completely clear, which is that there is weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent a source of infection of going from somebody who is infected to the people around them. Now of course under our current circumstances, anybody who has symptoms really must stay at home. And that’s the thing that people have done so brilliantly. But we are also concerned that some people are infected who don’t have symptoms or maybe don’t have symptoms yet, and that is the reason that SAGE has put so much effort into looking at this question. But the answer is clear that the evidence is weak and the effect is small. And we’ve passed that on to our colleagues in government with which to make a decision. Turning onto your question about hand washing and keeping surfaces clean, we have always absolutely been really majored on hand washing because that’s the way you keep the inside of your house and your family safe when you come in from outdoors. We would also recommend always keeping the surfaces in your house clean. That would seem like common sense to me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (35:27);Thanks very much. Thanks, Ben. The next question is from Dominic [Yaton 00:35:32] at the metro. Dominic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Dominic: (35:35);Hello, Secretary of State. You said that you knew from the start that there was a very significant challenge with care homes. So why were care homes not told to ban visitors until March the 16th? And why were figures on deaths outside hospitals not published until March 31st?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (35:57);The collection of the information from the care home sector has been more difficult than from the NHS by the distributed nature of the care system. There’s 15,000 care homes, and they’re part of 10,000 different organizations. And so, I’m glad we managed to get the data collection. On the point about visitors, that was based on clinical advice. And I’ll explain the reason that our clinical advisors gave us, which is that before there was a widespread incidence of coronavirus across the community as a whole, the critical thing is that, in a care home, having visitors also has a positive impact both against the loneliness of the residents but also on their longevity and their mental health. So these are difficult judgments and there are no easy recommendations to make. And so, absolutely, we are guided by that clinical advice."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (37:12);When it was necessary to make that change, which is quite a firm change, then we did so. So, I understand. Of course I understand the focus now on care homes and the questions from the media, but it’s something we’ve been working on incredibly hard right from the start. And really, one of the things that has happened in this crisis is that social care alongside the NHS have both been seen as these two absolutely vital parts of our society. And I think that that’s a good thing that we recognize and value them in that way. James Kayvan at the Daily Star."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","James Kayvan: (37:58);Hi. I just wanted to ask, first of all, there’s increasing frustration over what people see as mixed messaging from the government around the social distancing measures. On the one hand we’ve seen long queues at DIY stores, while on the other police are moving people on for sitting alone outside and sunbathing in parks. As increasing numbers of people return to work and roads get busier, can you give greater clarity what you can and can’t do outside the house?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","James Kayvan: (38:20);And second, if I can just ask, there’ve been reports that ventilator productions is now being scaled back just weeks after you called on British industry to build thousands for the NHS. Will we be in a situation soon where we have a huge supply of these machines [inaudible 00:38:33] demand? And I just wondered what’s going to happen with that supply and will the production of new ventilators continue to be scaled back or do you still want more for the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (38:42);Thanks very much, indeed. Look, on the clarity, I can absolutely give you that clarity, James, which is that people should follow the social distancing rules and they should stay at home if at all possible because that protects the NHS. And so far the protection of the NHS is working. And this brings me to the second point, which is that…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (39:03);This brings me to the second point which is that it is good news that there are spare ventilated beds available in the NHS. There has been no point when somebody’s needed a ventilator and a ventilator has not been available, a ventilated bed, because it’s more than just the ventilator machine, of course you need the people as well to use them. That has been one of the things in this crisis that people said right at the start, that preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed will be extremely difficult. Some people told me to my face it would be impossible, but that so far has worked, and now with the number of people in the NHS in hospital with coronavirus falling, we can see that we’ve managed to keep the NHS able to treat everybody who needs it. That brings to the question of ventilators. We are still, yes, producing those ventilators."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (39:54);There are countries across the world who are now needing them because their curve is in a different position, and so we’re still working with those companies who I pay tribute to who’ve absolutely pulled the stops out and made sure that we have the ventilator capacity that we needed when the number of people on ventilators was at its peak, which I think was about three weeks ago, [inaudible 00:01:20]? About that. So I pay tribute to the ventilator challenge and everybody who participated in it, they’ve done an amazing job, and they have, and so far it’s been successful in ensuring we’ve always got those ventilators that people need. Chris Lloyd from the Northern Echo."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Chris Lloyd: (40:41);Afternoon. Thanks for having me. What is the time lag of the pandemics progress? As the country went into lockdown at the same time, is it possible that the regions, like here in the northeast, were locked down comparatively early and so might not be hit as hard as was once feared? Although I note in your earlier slide there was a slight uptake in all regions outside of London of the number of people in hospital. And will that have any impact on a second wave in the regions? And how will the time lag inform policy on lifting the lockdown? Do you imagine that some areas might ease before others or will we all be in or out of lockdown together, and then, hopefully I’m not outstaying my welcome here. Looking further ahead, northern manufacturing towns bore the brunt of previous economic downturns, so how will the government ensure its measures to help the country recover are regionally applicable in terms of manufacturing, infrastructure, even moving government jobs out of London?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (41:37);Well Chris, you’re very welcome here at the press conference. I’m going to ask Angela to answer the substance of the first part of your question, but the first thing I’d say is I want to pay tribute to the people of the northeast for staying at home and helping to ensure that the number of cases in the northeast has relatively low. And knowing Newcastle well as I do, I know that the people of the Northeast are very gregarious and have done their duty by staying at home, which is what is needed in these circumstances. On the economic question that you rightly raise, absolutely it is a top priority to make sure that we level up this country and that agenda will be, I think even more important once we’re through coronavirus and recovering from it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (42:37);Northeast councils have been allocated more than 600 million pounds as part of the business support package, and we’ve identified more than 50,000 business properties which may be able to receive a grant in the Northeast. So we are putting the economic support in place during the crisis, but I’m absolutely sure that after the crisis, the top priority of the government will be to level up and make sure that all parts of this country can recover together because that is going to be a huge task. If I can ask Professor McLean to answer on the shape of the curve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (43:20);Your observation is absolutely right, that London was always high above the other regions of England and evolved administrations, and interestingly there is a signal in there that London turned over perhaps a little bit earlier than other regions, and various of our scientists around the country are combing through that data and other places where we might be able to see that signal to see if they can find anything to explain why that should be so. If there is an effect, it’s quite small actually. It’s not a huge, great big difference between the regions. You are right that yesterday’s numbers were a little bit higher in most regions and the day before, but it’s a tiny effect. It’s well within the noise that we see in these data sets. I watched these data incredibly carefully and whilst I would much rather they went down absolutely regularly every day, an increase like that is not something that worries me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (44:22);The question of whether or not we should have regional policies, I think it’s a really interesting one. It’s the kind of thing that you can imagine epidemiologists all over the world, not just in this country, are puzzling over. I think there’s always a trade off, isn’t there, between making sure you do things that are incredibly beautifully tailored to each part of your population. And on the other hand, keeping things simple and actually also carrying on all being in this together. So I don’t have an answer for you for that at the moment, but I can reassure you that all the time, one of the things we do is we look at the data altogether and we disaggregate it and look at it in regions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (45:05);Thanks very much Chris. Have you got a follow up question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Chris Lloyd: (45:07);Yeah. I mean, I did ask about the time lag as well and whether different parts of the country might be ease from the lockdown at different times because of the time lag, or will we all be under the lockdown at the same time together?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (45:19);So that is a question that we’re looking at. There was a big benefit, I think, as we brought in the lockdown measures of the whole country moving together. We did think about moving with London and the Midlands first because they were more advanced in terms of the number of cases, but we decided that we are really in this together and the shape of the curve, if not the height of the curve, has been very similar across the whole country. It went up more in London, but it’s also come down more. But the broad shape has been similar, which is what you’d expect given that we’ve all been living through the same lockdown measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (46:02);The other thing to say is that it isn’t just about the level, it’s also about the slope of the curve, and if the R goes above one anywhere, then that would eventually lead to an exponential rise and a second peak and an overwhelming of the NHS in that area unless it’s addressed. So although the level of the number of cases is different in different parts, the slope of the curve has actually been remarkably similar across the country. So that argues for doing things as a whole country together. I hope that makes sense. Thanks very much for coming Chris. Appreciate it. Finally, Adam Vaughn from The New Scientist."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Adam Vaughn: (46:48);Hi, you said you were recruiting 18,000 contact tracers. I wanted to ask, how many do you have today, what date will you hit 18,000 and how important are those tracers as a strategy for controlling the virus after the lockdown? And secondly, we heard today that the NHS contact tracing out where will be ready within three weeks. What’s your goal for the number of people you want to download it and how will you incentivize them to do so?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (47:16);I knew we’d get some tough questions from The New Scientist. The answer to your questions are as soon as possible and as many as possible. But I know that’s not exactly a numerical answer. We’re recruiting the contact tracers. I’m sorry I don’t have the information to hand as to exactly how many we’ve recruited, but that is underway. We hope to have the contact tracers who will help when we find a positive test to work out who they’ve been in contact with and make sure they do the appropriate thing. We hope to have the contact tracers in place before or at the same as the app goes live and you’re right on the app."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (47:59);We’re expecting that to be ready by the middle of May and both of these things together, because they work together along with the testing and they’ll help us to keep the level of new cases down once we’ve used social distancing measures to get those new cases down. That’s the best thing for health and it’s the best thing for the economy. It’s a work in progress. I appreciate that, other than saying the middle of May, I haven’t given you numerical details. I don’t have the data to hand, but I’ll try to find that for you. And then on the how many people, the more people who download the app and keep their Bluetooth on, the more effective the app is going to be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (48:49);So there is no answer other than as many as possible because if everybody downloads it will just be more effective at spotting who people have been in contact with through contact tracing and helping alongside the human contact tracing for people to be able to keep the R down by catching those who they may have transmitted the disease to. It’s also of course tied with the rules around isolation because if you are … What really also matters is if you’ve been in substantial contact with somebody who’s tested positive, making sure we get the right rules around what that person is then required and asked to do is also a critical part of this, this infrastructure that we’re building."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Speaker 3: (49:43);Well, I’d just ask a follow up question. From what you’ve just said, you said that the human contact traces and the app will work in tandem, and you’re saying if the app is coming in three weeks, does that mean the target for the 18,000 is in three weeks?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (49:56);Before or at the same time as the app. Yeah. Okay. Good stuff. Thank you very much indeed. Great to have The New Scientist at the Downing Street briefing and I hope my answer was scientifically valid. Thank you very much for joining us and no doubt see you again soon."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (00:02);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, and also professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England. Let me just start by saying I think, on behalf of us all, a huge congratulations to the prime minister and to Carrie on the wonderful news of the birth of their baby boy. I have spoken to the PM and I can tell you that both mum and son are doing really well. Now, next, let me give an update on the latest data on coronavirus from our Cobra data file. And I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program, as of today, there have now been 818,539 tests for the virus across the U.K., including 52,429 tests that took place yesterday. 165,221 people have tested positive. And that’s an increase of 4,076 cases on yesterday’s number."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (01:06);Now, as the health sector announced yesterday, from today, we’re moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths so that that’s in all settings are included wherever the individual has tested positive for COVID-19, rather than just those in hospitals. And those figures show that, up to yesterday on the new measure, we have recorded an additional 3, 811 deaths in total. And I think it’s just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period from the 2nd of March to the 28th of April. So, they don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (01:47);Sadly, today’s figures show an additional 765 deaths compared to yesterday. I’ll let professor Doyle talk us through the data in detail in a little while. But I think we must never lose sight of the fact that behind every statistic there are many human lives that have been tragically lost before their time. We also pay tribute, of course, to those caring for the sick. And yesterday at 11 o’clock in the morning, the whole country observed a minute silence, a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of all of our frontline workers who have died whilst dedicated themselves to caring for and serving others."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (02:28);Now, on the 16th of April, I set out five principles that would guide our approach to the transition away from the current set of social distancing measures in place and into a second phase. We continue to see evidence in the data of a flattening of the peak of the virus. And that is only happening because we delivered on the two central pillars of our strategic approach to defeating coronavirus. The first one was that we reinforced our NHS capacity through the Nightingale Hospitals, the extra critical care capacity, more ventilator beds, and extra doctors and nurses on the front line. And the second is that we introduced the social distancing measures at the right time, guided by the scientific and medical evidence. And the public’s overwhelming support for those rules has helped save lives and protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (03:18);Now, we’re still coming through the peak. And this is, as I’ve said before, a delicate and dangerous moment in this crisis. So, I know that a lot of people have made a lot of sacrifices, which is why it’s so important that we don’t let up now and risk undoing all of that hard work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (03:38);So, as we look to the future, our five tests remain absolutely key. First, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, preventing it from being overwhelmed. Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths. Thirdly, we need to see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels across all the relevant areas and settings. And fourth, we must be confident the NHS will be able to cope with future demands. And that includes as a result of any changes to existing measures or new measures that we may need to take."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (04:17);Fifth, and I think this is probably the most critical of the five principles, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. A second spike will be harmful to public health. And it would result in many more deaths from COVID-19. That itself would lead to a second lockdown, inflicting further prolonged economic pain on the country. And, as the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said last week, that wouldn’t just be economically dangerous. It would inflict a serious blow to public confidence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (04:56);So, this issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it, it’s not a theoretical risk. And it’s not something that’s just confined to the United Kingdom. Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the last week, they’ve seen a rise in the transmission rate of Coronavirus. Chancellor Merkel has said publicly, and she’s made it clear that they might need a second lockdown in Germany if the infection rate continues to rise. So, this is a very real risk. And it’s vital we proceed carefully guided by the scientific advice so that our next step through this crisis is a sure footed one. We mustn’t gamble away the sacrifices and the progress that we’ve made. We must continue to follow the scientific evidence. And we must continue to take the right decisions at the right moment in time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (05:45);Now, we are working on all of the potential options for a second phase. There is light at the end of the tunnel, whether you’re an NHS worker on the frontline working tirelessly shift after shift, or a parent at home with young children. But we do need to be patient and we need to be careful as we come through what is a moment of maximum risk. So, we’ll wait for Sages next review of the data in early May. We’re ramping up the testing with capacity now at over 73,000 per day and 52,429 tests carried out per day. And eligibility for those tests is now being expanded again further to include anyone who needs to go to work and can’t work remotely and who has symptoms. It also includes anyone over 65 with symptoms and all care home residents, as well as care home staff. And, at the same time, as we ramp up the testing capacity, we’ll keep working on our tracking and tracing capability, which is going to be a key component in the next phase of this crisis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (06:52);We’ll continue to source ventilators and personal protective equipment both at home and abroad. Paul Dayton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production and supply. We continue to source PPE from abroad. We’re setting ourselves out as the international buyer of choice in the international marketplace. And I can tell you that, in the last ten days, we’ve secured over five million masks from China. We’ve had three flights with gowns from Turkey. Because we know that every single one of those items of PPE is needed by those working so hard on the front line, both in NHS and also in our care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (07:31);And our international effort isn’t confined to procurement. I can tell you we’ve also made enormous progress in returning British nationals who otherwise would have been at risk of being stranded abroad. And it’s worth just noting that, since the outbreak in Wu Han, we’ve helped an estimated 1.3 million British nationals return on commercial flights. And we’ve done that by working with the airlines and with those governments to make sure that the flights can run and that the airspace is left open. And we brought back over 200,000 British nationals from Spain, 50,000 from Australia, and over 11,000 from Pakistan, to name but just three countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (08:12);As well as those commercial flights, we’ve also chartered flights where commercial options were not possible. And we’ve now reached the stage where we’ve brought back over 20,000 British nationals on 21 flights. And that includes 9,000 British nationals who had been brought back from India, 2,000 from South Africa, and 1,200 from Peru."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (08:34);So, it’s also, just in terms of repatriations, worth bearing in mind that on the 17th of March when we changed our travel advice for those traveling on cruise ships, there were something like 19,000 British passengers on 60 cruise ships sailing around the world. And, as the border restrictions were put in place by country after country, we faced a daunting task in getting our people home. But we stuck at it. And six weeks later, we’ve now got all 19,000 British passengers back home, safe and sound."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (09:11);So, that was an enormous effort. And we recognize that the job isn’t yet done. We’ll continue with this unprecedented effort with further charter flights coming back from New Zealand, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, amongst others, over the next week or so. So, I must pay tribute, at this point, to all of the outstanding work our conciliar teams working night and day at the FCO in London, but also at our embassies and our high commissioners around the world have been putting in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (09:40);Finally, the Health Secretary announced last week that U.K. trials have started as we draw on the incredible scientific talent that we’ve got in this country to pursue a vaccine. And that effort too has an international dimension to it. So, today we announced that the U.K. will provide GAVI, which is the International Vaccine Alliance, with the equivalent of 330 million pounds each year over the next five years as we seek to come up with a vaccine, both to protect the British people, but also to help immunize millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people right around the world, combining the depth of our innovative knowhow with the big hearted determination that has characterized our national effort to defeat the Coronavirus. And having said that, I’m now going to ask Yvonne to talk us through the latest data slides. Yvonne, over to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (10:31);Thank you, Secretary of State. We have a selection of measures and slides here today to show. And the first one is just to remind us of the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. As the Secretary of State has said, this is about capacity, it’s about a fall in the daily deaths, it’s about reliable data, and also that we have good supplies of material for our NHS and care staff and that we’re confident that the adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (11:05);But moving to the actual slides, and the next slide, please, shows what is going on out in society at the moment. This is a transport slide which shows the use of various forms of transport. As we’ve seen up to now, very dramatic falls in most modes, but there has been an uptick in motor vehicles. And the message here really is that we are still passing through this peak. And this use of motor vehicles, it’s the highest working day use since the 23rd of March. And we really have to be vigilant that most people are making huge efforts to stay at home and save lives. And this is slightly worrying. So, please do stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives, and go out for the necessities. And the transport data will reflect that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (12:02);And the next slide, please, is about new cases in the NHS and in the country at the moment, in the UK. And we can see here the increasing amount of testing that’s going on through the orange bars. But basically, the cases have remained broadly stable over the last weeks. And that is good news. But I want to move on really to show you a little more about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (12:27);The next slide, please, does show this. So, now we have a slide about people in hospital. And this is broadly good news because the numbers in hospital have decreased from over 18,000 to over 15,000. That’s a 16% decrease. And it’s manifest in all regions. You can see how London had an early peak. But now, London is declining in its use of hospital facilities. But, of course, other regions may overtake that. So, we do have to be careful. As I say, we are passing through this peak. We’re not through this yet. And the next slide, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (13:03);… To speak. We’re not through this yet. And the next slide, thank you is about critical care bed use in the UK and this means all beds, both high dependency and intensive care wards use, and this is good news because we can see here that 40% of the beds are being used. That means there is critical care capacity, and that is a credit to the NHS for how it has got us through this crisis to this stage, and there is capacity and room for patients who need it. The next slide please is about the cumulative daily COVID deaths. Now this is an interesting slide where we’ll begin to get into a little bit more into what is going on with deaths. So the deaths in hospital is the blue line, and that is what has been measured very reliably up to now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (13:52);But now public health England, with support from the NHS, has been in a position to congregate deaths in all settings based on confirmed tests that we see coming through our labs. So what we can see here is first of all that the deaths on the orange line are confirmed deaths from coronavirus, that tells us what exactly is going on in all settings. And when I say all settings, I mean hospitals, health protection team, the local outbreak teams in the community broadly and in care homes. So now we see that there is a divergence. It’s not a huge, it’s about a 20% divergence, but it’s good news in the main in terms of what it is showing because what it’s showing is we are getting a comprehensive picture and this is most important for control. So could I move on to the next slide please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (14:46);Which is about the daily deaths, which is excluding deaths outside of hospital. So these are hospital deaths, which is what we were looking at in the previous slide in the blue side. It shows this declining trend of deaths in hospitals, which the trend started to increase at the end of March and we can see it declining. But to restress, we’re still coming through the peak because of course this doesn’t represent all deaths, but it is good news about deaths in hospital and that is also a credit to the good treatment in hospital. The next slide looks at COVID deaths in all settings and you can see there it’s a cumulative line there, the orange line. And it’s good to do it that way because otherwise you get swings and ups and downs when weekends occur and people are not sure what has happened with deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (15:42);But with the line you can see the trend and the trend is quite flat actually. And it may begin to decline, but we’re not convinced of that yet. But it’s good to show that. And the reason it starts at the 30th of March is because this is about all settings. That was the time when we were able to start measuring that from then on. And so this is a seven day rolling average and it clearly … And it’s very important, we know what’s happening daily. Now on to global. So global death comparisons are two slides here. The first one is actually just crude numbers. And you can see here a portion that looks like the United States has a very high number of deaths and other countries perhaps are aligning with each other. But the point on this slide, the slide says a number of things."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (16:33);First of all, and these measures may not be comprehensive measures of death … And we’re very keen to do here and are doing now comprehensively. So for instance in Spain, we’re not absolutely clear whether the deaths in Spain include all care home deaths. And this is understandable because it’s very complex and difficult to get these measures, particularly on a daily basis, which is why the news today about being able to do this on a daily basis is very good news. Although of course the news about numbers of deaths is not good news and, again, stresses how dangerous this virus is, how sad it is for those individuals, and how we have to be ever vigilant about how we look after each other and how we adhere to the requests to stay at home, protect the NHS, and particularly to save lives. Now the last slide is also interesting because this now shows the cumulative death number per million population, and this shows a very different pattern where we can see two measures for the UK, the hospital deaths and the comprehensive deaths. They’re not hugely different on this scale, but you can see where we are now tracking much more along our European neighbors and also, and we’ve seen Italy and Spain there and France, but the US of course has dropped because we’re now measuring rates per a million. Other countries have increased. The important thing here is that it is … Our measures are comprehensive, they’re daily and they’re taken in all care settings. So I thought you would wish to see the two contrasts. Thank you [inaudible 00:18:22]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (18:22);Thank you very much indeed. I think we’ll now turn to questions from the media and I think first up we’ve got Hugh Pin from the BBC. Hugh, you there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Hugh Pin: (18:34);Foreign secretary, question about testing. What support will you give care homes in administering and organizing tests and helping them keep residents and staff safe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (18:49);Well, I’m happy to let either Yvonne or Jonathan come in, but just to be clear, we’ve expanded the eligibility. Eligibility now includes anyone in a care home where they’re resident or staff and we have obviously had a distribution issue. There’s no sugarcoating the challenge we’ve had with that, we’ve helped deliver them through the local resilience forum. We are getting the clipper service up and running and the military have also done an exceptional job. So whether it’s the supply, and which we’re ramping up in the way I described and the health secretary has explained, or the delivery, are we doing everything that we possibly can? Yvonne, I don’t know whether you or Jonathan want to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (19:33);Well and thanks. Yes indeed Hugh. So there are a number of ways that testing is and will continue to happen at scale in care homes since this epidemic in care homes, which still continues and there has been a huge local effort both through local government, our directors of public health, our health protection teams, but increasingly with support from national endeavors to get the tests to the home to make sure staff get the testing they need. This will continue for some considerable time until we are convinced that we have got under this epidemic in the care homes, which is of course utmost concern."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (20:11);Anything else you’d like to ask on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Hugh Pin: (20:14);Couldn’t testing really have started sooner than that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (20:18);Well, Hugh, testing has always occurred during outbreaks and that has never been given up at a local level. Our health protection team supported by others, the NHS locally, have been into and going into care homes throughout the country. But the scale and the speed of this epidemic is really in the last couple of weeks, and there is a huge national and local endeavor to both not just test, which is very important, but to also understand the measures that would make a difference in care homes. And to look at that in a very rapid way looking at the evidence so that we can put in place measures that protect people. People are absolutely passionate about getting this right, but it is the most complex sector to get to 16,000 homes, a lot of places to go under … Critical to use local intelligence as to where the risks are highest."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (21:11);Also Hugh it’s just worth saying that of course you’d have to have an enormous testing capacity to deliver what I think you’re suggesting we could have or should have. One of the big challenges we’ve had is asymptomatic people coming to and in and out of care homes, whether it’s other care home workers who work in more than one place and it just staff coming in or indeed members of a family and there’s an onset, it’s obviously a very decentralized system, but the social distancing and the control over transmission in and out of care homes, it’s probably the single biggest factor and obviously we’re doing everything we can to give the guidance and give the support to care homes to achieve that. Dan Hughet, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Hughet: (21:55);Thank you secretary of state. And we’ve discovered that hospices are being denied access to government managed supplies of PPE, of personal protective equipment. Unlike hospitals and care homes, they are not being included in the main NHS supply chain managed by the government through supply chain coordination limited. Instead, hospice are still relying on donations of PPE and they’re having to buy their own largely on the open market at hugely inflated prices. It means the hospices have told us that they could run out of PPE within a matter of days. Why is it the hospices are being treated differently to hospitals and care homes when it comes to accessing PPA?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (22:32);Well, again, I’ll defer to Jonathan and Yvonne, but basically, and I don’t know of course the hospices that you’ve talked to, but we’ve been guided throughout by the NHS about, A, where the shortfalls have been and, B, what’s the priority? And we’ve always said that the priority is being on the frontline and the NHS and care homes. But obviously we want to make sure we’ve got enough PPE. That’s why we’re doing all of these flights from abroad, that’s why Paul Dayton’s ramping up the domestic capacity to get to anyone that may need it. And obviously hospice is a very important area as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (23:09);Yeah, secretary of state. It’s very important we ascertain where these problems are and that’s why local intelligence is very important. The guidance covers all places where people are at risk. So that’s very important to say. There is no differentiation here in where people are at risk and what they might need. What may often be lacking is the knowledge of where there are pockets of problems, and we’ve had this throughout. So it is welcome to know this and there are ways in which hospices can actually make known what they need through helplines. But if that isn’t happening then it’s very important that we do hear this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (23:45);Thank you. Do you want to supplement anything you want to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Hughet: (23:49);Yeah. Thank you so secretary of state. On that, Hospice UK, the main charity, I understand they’ve been coordinating and speaking to the relevant bodies within government to explain and have provided evidence that shows they need this PPE. So you’re absolutely right to say must go where it needs to, but they have made a very strong case to say they need it. They’re treating three times as many terminally ill patients now than they were this time last year. They’re treating people with coronavirus, so they definitely do need this PPE. I think the assurance they want is when they’ll be included in the NHS supply chain because they say they are caring for very second vulnerable people as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (24:26);Oh absolutely. And my heart goes out to all of those working in hospices, those that have been cared for and their family and we’ll do everything we can in the way Yvonne described to make sure that we get PPPE to them as soon as we physically can. Beth Rippe from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Beth Rippe: (24:44);Thank you. First, secretary of state, on Sunday you said you were, and I quote you, reasonably confident that deaths in care homes are coming down at about the same rate more broadly as captured by the NHS figures. What does this new data tell you? Are we actually approaching a peak in care homes, if not overall? And Professor Van Tom, extra deaths today show the situation even worse than we knew. But it’s true too that these numbers could be underreported still in part because of low testing levels. Should we be braced for a farther upward revision of these figures in the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (25:25);So Beth, look. In the way that Yvonne described the importance of getting these measures refined is that we’ve got a clearer picture and of course what we’d like is a perfect picture and we’re constantly looking to see whether we can modify and glean a more granular picture. The reality is, and I think when Sage gave its evidence on its review of the social distancing measures around the 16th of April, I think it was the press conference, so it was shortly before then. They were very clear that the R level was coming down. It was below one in the community, but there were challenges in hospital settings. We’re getting to grips with that, but also in-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (26:03);There were challenges in hospital settings. We’re getting to grips with that, but also in care homes. So we’ve known about this challenge, and we’re doing everything we can to meet it. PPE is one of the aspects of it, testing is another, but probably the single biggest thing, and this is tough in a decentralized, localized set of care homes, is making sure that we control the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that may risk transmitting the virus. So alongside all of those other practical measures, disseminating that guidance, refining that guidance, supporting those care homes as best we can is the surest way that we will really get a grip and then drive down those infection levels in the care home scenario. Yvonne, is there anything you’d like to add, or Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (26:47);I might just add, but Jonathan can supplement this. So Beth, the question is opposite to what CQC also measures. So CQC will also put out deaths in care homes, and they will not always be confirmed by testing. So in due course, those deaths sadly may occur on death certificates. So we may expect more than we’re seeing at the moment. Yes. Sorry, Jonathan, that was just my [crosstalk 00:27:18]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (27:17);And it’s worth just bearing in mind, as Yvonne said earlier in relation to the slides, what we’re trying to do is get the most granular picture. I think when it comes to the international comparisons, certainly not all of the countries are recording even to the level that we’ve got to now, which is why some of those international comparisons, but we’re just committed to maximum transparency. One because people should know the full picture and secondly, when you know more about the data, you’ve got a better chance of gripping it in the way that we’re absolutely committed to doing. Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:45);Yes. So thank you, Beth. I’ll answer your question in a slightly different way and say that clearly we have moved to a system of recording deaths that is better and more granular because it covers more than just the hospital setting, but in epidemiology terms, eventually we will be able to compute a different estimate of deaths called excess deaths and that is really accepting that across the year deaths go up in the winter and down in the summer in a broadly oscillating wave and one can work out what the average is over multiple years and then work out what in this particular coronavirus pandemic our departure has been from that in terms of total number of deaths. And that will give us an excess death figure and that will be highly comparable when other excess death figures come out across the world, including many parts of Europe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:46);In fact, there’s a standardized methodology that the Europeans use for calculating excess mortality. So to your point, will there be more? I think I’d kind of turn that question slightly or turn the answer and say in time we’ll have a much better answer when we start to look at excess mortality as a total, which will take into account both deaths related to COVID-19 and deaths that may have occurred, not due to COVID-19 at all, but as a consequence of the crisis. And some of those will take time to come through and I’m afraid that is a phenomenon that we will face right across the world with this awful crisis that we’re in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (29:34);Beth, do you want to pick up on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Beth: (29:36);Yeah, just quickly. Just to follow up, it’s been really encouraging that although the death toll has been horrific, but it has been falling in hospitals. Now you have the care home data, is it falling in hospitals, but that death tally going up still in care homes?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (29:52);I’m not sure we have the data, but I’ll-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (29:54);I don’t think we can say that quite yet, Beth. I wouldn’t make any predictions about what will happen in care homes, but we should know that soon because the hospital curve has declined. Bearing in mind that still the majority of deaths do occur in hospital, including those who are resident in care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (30:17);Beth, thanks very much. Andy Bell from Channel 5."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (30:21);Thanks very much. You have your five tests that you say have to be met before we can move on in terms of lockdown. Right now, how many of those tests do you think you’re passing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (30:35);Well, as I said, when I set them out, we will need the advice from SAGE, which was going to be three weeks after, I think the 16th of April, so it will come early May. So we don’t know yet. There is some positive signs in the data, but as Yvonne has said and as we’ve been at pains to say we’re at a delicate and dangerous moment in this challenge. We’re coming through the peak, but we’re not there yet, which is why keeping on focusing on the social distancing measures, which has been one of the great successes of the approach taken because of the support of the British people is so important. So people sitting at home watching this have saved lives by following that guidance. And until we’re out of the woods, if I can put it like that, they need to keep doing that. And we won’t know that we’ve reached that point until SAGE give us that review of the evidence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (31:24);I can I come back in on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (31:24);Sure, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (31:26);But the government has said several times that the NHS is not being overwhelmed, is not being overtopped. Are you saying you’re not even satisfied at this stage that you can say you’ve passed test number one?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (31:37);Well, then it just quite clearly hasn’t been overwhelmed. That’s been the second key critical bit of the strategy which we delivered successfully. It’s a great credit to those in the front line, but we have also got the ventilator beds, the critical care capacity up, the military have done a great job in supporting the new Nightingale hospitals. So we’re confident at this stage, but of course if you look at the five tests, Andy, and I know you’re taking this very seriously, we’ve also said that we need to make sure that we can see to the future that that will still be the case, and also with any changes we might make and what that would do, not just to the coronavirus infection rate as we’ve seen in Germany, but also to the non-COVID cases. We need to be confident the NHS will be able to cope. So you’re right, absolutely to point to the five tests, and I’ve just got to say at this moment in time, we’re waiting for SAGE’s evidence on all five aspects, which we’re expecting in early May."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (32:35);Can I bring in Jason Groves from the Daily Mail?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (32:40);Thanks. Foreign Secretary, you may have seen overnight the new mail force charity has brought in a million pounds with the PPE from China. You know how difficult that is. You’ve got your own challenges with PPE. I wondered how helpful that sort of private sector initiative is and to Professor Van-Tam, we’ve heard a little bit about this idea that the virus perhaps fades more slowly outdoors than it does indoors. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about that and what the implications of that might be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (33:13);Well, Jason, fantastic mail force campaign, a hundred thousand miles, 50,000 overalls, all going to those frontline workers in the NHS in care homes. I’ve just got to pay tribute, the Daily Mail has really contributed to that national effort that we were talking about and it all counts. So a huge thanks, I think from the government side."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:37);Jonathan. Okay, so thank you for the question about how the virus spreads and to what extent it spreads and if I can just replay the question back to you to be sure I heard it right. You were asking about the difference between indoors and outdoors?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (33:54);Yeah, that’s right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:56);Thank you. Okay, so we have learned a great deal over the years from studying influenza and patterns of transmission of influenza, and I accept that the coronavirus is a new virus, it is not entirely the same as influenza and we are getting more and more data on transmission of COVID-19 as the days and weeks roll by. But nevertheless there is a definite truism across all of the science literature that ventilation is the most critical part of reducing transmission from respiratory viruses. And if you think about being outdoors, first of all, by and large distancing between human beings is greater anyway, but if you just stand still for a moment and experience just normal breezes and air currents around you, you absolutely get a sense that any kind of plumes of anything are going to be very rapidly dispersed. And from that perspective it is absolutely categorically clear that outdoor spaces with higher degrees of ventilation are less problematic environments for transmission than indoor spaces."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:17);And of course you only have to go as far as thinking about flu and summer, winter and the way we live our lives. In the winter, we live indoors, in conditions of relatively low ventilation with the windows closed. In the summer, we go outdoors, we leave the doors and the windows open when we’re at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (35:38);Jason, do you want to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (35:39);Yeah. Well, thanks for your comments and I was going to come back on that latter point. People are obviously thinking about what’s going to happen in this next phase. Given that difference, might it mean that there is some hope for things like garden centers, outdoor events, like park runs, going to the beach, maybe even beer gardens before people sort of give up hope?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:04);Thank you for the question and I completely get it and understand why you’re asking the question. SAGE absolutely is keeping all of that evidence under very considerably detailed review and that evidence has been formulated into guidance that we are putting forwards to ministers on a periodic basis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:28);Now in terms of any of the settings that you mentioned, I just want to take us through the journey a little and say that these are complex and at various different points they might involve the congregation of individuals and one has to be very painstaking and very careful about thinking through some of these before we make the wrong move to relax measures. And so from that perspective, I think all of your comments are valid, but I think we have to be extremely surefooted and extremely painstaking about this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:12);This virus will absolutely come back. You’ve seen Secretary of State refer to the resurgence in Germany and the difficult considerations that are going on there. This is with us for quite some time, potentially for as long as until we get a vaccine. So from that perspective we have to be really careful and really surefooted, and I’m just not going to suggest for a moment that any of this should be rushed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (37:40);Thanks, Jason. Dan Bloom from the Daily Mirror."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Bloom: (37:43);Hello. I’d like to ask if we had been able to access better testing and screening earlier than we did for care home residents. So for example, were testing those discharged from hospital before mid-April and some of the other things the government has introduced, might some of the deaths that have been published today been avoided?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (38:03);I think there’s always learning in a unprecedented unique crisis like this that we’ll want to feed back in to make sure that we can refine and fine tune the measures we’re taking. You’ll know, Dan, we take the actions and the steps that we take on the best scientific evidence we’ve got at the time. I think in relation to care homes, and as I mentioned before, the key thing above all is to manage the transmission, of the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that might carry the virus. And that of course includes family members and friends, it includes people that are working in more than one care home setting, it includes NHS staff. So on top of testing and BP and all the things I understand you want to raise, I think that’s probably the single most important aspect. Do you want to come back on anything else there, Dan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Bloom: (38:53);I’d quite like to ask the medical experts, what they think of the same question because they may have an opinion on it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (39:00);Of course. Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (39:02);Yeah. Thank you, Dan-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (39:02);Of course. Yvonne?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (39:02);Yeah. Thank you Dan. So it’s a very good question and it’s also a learning one, but I put it this way, where there have been outbreaks in care homes, there has always been intervention throughout this. That would be no different to normal practice. What we have learned a lot about is how the virus is behaving in different populations. And one of the various other things that we have found is that the virus, when older people get this virus, it is affecting predominantly older people, particularly people over 75, and one of the reasons that the deaths are high there is that actually their demise quite quickly if they get the dose of this virus that perhaps a younger person might be able to put over their shoulder because of the way their immune system works. So that’s one feature. So it may not even be possible to have got to the test by the time the event happens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (39:54);Second, we’ve now learned from looking at the literature that we’ve asked and asked what is it that would make a difference to stop this epidemic in a home? And the movement of staff is an absolutely critical one and how the virus actually moves within a home. And that has really only begun to become evident since we’ve been able to look at new techniques like genomics. And that has given us a huge insight into the dynamics of what is happening within a home. And not every home will be the same in the way that people, residents and the staff interact, the use of bank staff. But there are some very interesting learning that we’ve come across quite recently. Now whether testing makes would have made a huge difference or not, it’s impossible to see at the moment. And that’s one thing we wanted learn but there has been testing but I think there are possibly more fundamental and structural issues about how care homes are run in an epidemic that we are now looking to implement."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (40:56);Thanks Dan. Matt Foster from Politics Home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Matt Foster: (41:00);Hi for secretary of state. Your colleagues have spoken about us all being in this together, but there are a sizable number of people in the UK who despite paying taxes are barred from claiming universal credit, housing benefit, or free school meals for their kids because the home office has deemed that they have no recourse to public funds. Some of those people are working in key frontline jobs right now in the NHS, social care, and its delivery drivers. Will the government consider at least temporarily causing an RPS status during the outbreak and if not, what reassurance can you give people that they’re not going to be shut out the same help we all may need to rely on during an economic crisis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (41:41);Look, I absolutely understand the point and obviously we feel for anyone who’s going through the challenges, whether professionally or in their home. I know the home secretary has been looking at this very carefully, she keeps these issues under constant review. I think she went before the home affairs committee today and said that we’ll always at new measures and what more can be done, particularly in relation, I think, to frontline workers from overseas who are working within care homes or the NHS, so I can’t give a commitment, but I can tell you that the home secretary is very carefully looking at that and the government wants to make sure we’re as sensitive and as flexible in our approach as we possibly can be. Do you want to come back with another one there, Matt?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Matt Foster: (42:24);That’s fine. Thanks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (42:24);Very good. And then finally Peter Madly from The Express and Star."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (42:31);Thank you, secretary of state. A question for the medical experts schools across the Westman and just starting to consider how things might look once they’re up and running again. The education secretary said today that schools will reopen in phases and clearly some form of social distancing will be required. Can you give us an idea of how you think social distancing will work in a school setting and do you envisage home education continuing for some pupils into next year?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (42:58);Secondly, a question for you, secretary of state. You mentioned repatriation flights before. There’s still thousands of British citizens stranded in India, particularly in the Punjab region, a lot from West Midlands and that area of the country in fact. The CTM charter team has said this week that more than 20,000 people have registered for flights from an Amritsar in the North, there’s only one flight every couple of days with a maximum capacity of 300 so people who are running out of money and medicine have been told it’s not possible to confirm when they’ll be able to get back. Now, do you have an idea of how many Brits are stuck in India, and are you planning to increase the number of repatriation flights from Northern cities so these people can return home?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (43:41);Well, thanks very much. And look, can I first of all say the incredible effort from the West Midlands where you’re reporting both the NHS care homes and frankly the people following the social distancing guidance, it’s made a massive difference. We follow the regional impact of all the measures that we’re putting in place and NHS capacity. And I know the West Midlands are putting an incredible shift. On repatriation flights, and just to give you a sense, we’ve already charted, so separate from the commercial flights, 58 returning more than 12,000 people from across South Asia."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (44:14);I can tell you that in recent days we’ve announced 28 more charter flights with the capacity to get around 77,000 more Brits back home. They’ll return home, that scheduling would be up until about May the seventh, they include 14 flights from India another nine from Pakistan, and five from Bangladesh. So we’re doing everything we can to get stranded Brits from the West Midlands and right across the country home. And as I’ve said in my earlier remarks, I think the foreign office and the department of transport and our missions abroad put in a heroic shift. But look, the jobs not yet done and as long as there are people that are in a predicament, we want to see what more we can do. I don’t know whether Jonathan or Yvonne wants to come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (45:01);Schools?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (45:02);Schools. Yes, please Jonathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (45:04);So I’ve got two sons, Alex and Theo at home, 11 and 12, and I know exactly how difficult it is for them wanting to go to school and the stress and strain that this is placing on people. But I’m absolutely clear that it was the right thing to do to close schools when we did and equally we now have to be very careful indeed about how we relax social distancing measures and when we do it and clearly there are multiple combinations of how one might think about that. I’m not going to go into those in detail because the scientific thinking is not yet complete or settled on those. It is still a matter of detailed daily and deliberation and study, and clearly as part of that relaxing schools is in the mix. Precisely how one would do that, I’m not going to comment further because I think there are multiple permutations that you can think of and we have to work through those carefully, one by one scientifically and get the best and the most optimized answer we can. So I wouldn’t want to make any premature comments about exactly how and to what extent schools are going to being involved in how we relax social distancing carefully, painstakingly and as and when we can with safety."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (46:34);Peter, is there anything else you’d like to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (46:37);Yes, Mr. Van Tam. If I can be a bit more direct with my question in that case, do you think it’s possible for groups of young people to stay two meters apart all day long in a school?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (46:48);I think that will be very difficult with a classroom of four year olds, five year olds. I think that will be really tricky. I think we have to think through all of those measures and how that might work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (47:00);Thanks very much Peter. I think we’ve now got a couple of questions from members of the public. We’ve got Matthew from Surrey who’s asking what has been done to ensure that visitors or returning citizens coming through British ports and airports are going into a 14 day quarantine and why hasn’t this been implemented before? I’ll turn to Yvonne to answer this, but we’ve looked at this regularly. I’ve asked this question actually quite a few times, and so far the advice has come back that actually it wouldn’t make any significant material difference to stopping the spread. It may become more relevant as we progress through this crisis and as we bear down on the transmission rates within the UK. But Yvonne, I don’t know if there’s anything you’d add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (47:50);Secretary of state, not very much. So Matthew, thank you. It’s a really interesting question and obviously as we move into a new phase over the coming months, it’s one that will come back again and the scientific advisory committee is looking at all of the measures that ports could and should perhaps do implement that would make a difference. That’s the important thing because otherwise we’re just disrupting everything for no particular gain and we have had some experience of it of course during the contained fees when we worked intensively with all the ports in Britain to ensure that we kept our citizens as safe as possible. And we’ve learned quite a bit from that. But there are a number of measures of which quarantine is one and it is being looked at."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (48:33);And of course as we keep the ports and the airports open for vital supply chains, that’s a consideration as well, but we’ll continue to keep that under review. I think there’s a second question which is coming up on the screen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Bob: (48:51);As there has been success so far in not overwhelming the NHS and there seems to be plenty of space in the Nightingale Hospitals, why can’t we remove some residents from care homes for their immediate safety? If this takes place immediately and perhaps with military assistance, this could save some lives. Is it feasible in any way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (49:14);Well, I’ll let Yvonne talk to the current situation. What I can say, it’s something that has been under constant discussion. Of course we want to make sure, and the Nightingale’s have been amazing and the military’s done a great job in supporting the NHS teams. We’ve got to make sure we’ve got the NHS capacities as we set out in our five principles for how we might move forward to the next phase that it’s not just there to deal with the current cases, but to deal with the future demands that may be put on the NHS, both in relation to the virus but also other health needs. But we’re looking at that, not least in the context of some of the cohorting that may need to be done, which hasn’t been done in some areas, some areas it has. So it’s certainly something that, again, remains under review. Yvonne, do you want to say a bit more on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (50:00);Thank you secretary of state and thank you Bob. So it is, and the Nightingale Hospitals, they operate on a number of different models and we’re looking at the difference between those models and whether they are adaptable to circumstances that may arise as we go forward, of which this would be one. And the issue about the home residence is that this has to be a humane solution for people and that it isn’t more damaging or harmful to have people move, particularly people who are already frail, vulnerable, maybe suffer from dementia. So it has to be looked at as a judgment in terms of what is the best thing to do for those people and what is the most humane intervention given the risk they may face. But it is certainly … It is something that is looked at and will be continued."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (50:46);It’s worth also just saying, Bob, that one of the pieces of learning that the cabinet office had from 2016, we looked at the lessons learned from the flu epidemic we had was that the shift of people out of the NHS and into the community, including care homes, was something that was important, which should be taken forward. But I understand your question. We’ve got to make sure all of these things are done safely, and that doesn’t mean that certain NHS facilities couldn’t be used in the way that you’ve described. So we’re looking at all of that. Thank you very much, Bob. Thanks everyone for all of your questions. And that brings to a close today’s Downing Street press conference. Thank you very much. (silence)."
