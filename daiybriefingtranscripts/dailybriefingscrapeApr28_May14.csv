"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (16:03);Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined today by Professor Jonathan Bantam. Let me start by updating you on the latest information from the Government’s Cobra data file."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (16:13);Through our monitoring and testing program, as of today, 2,219,281 tests for Coronavirus have now being carried out in the UK. Including a new record of 126,064 tests carried out yesterday. 233,151 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,446 cases since yesterday. 11,041 people are in hospital with COVID-19, that’s down 14% from a week ago. And sadly, of those tested positive for Coronavirus 33,614 have now died. That’s an increase of 428 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure does include all deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and friends as this Nation battles to defeat the disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (17:21);Today, I’m going to set out how, whilst the country has been a virtual standstill, this downtime has been used to fix and upgrade the Nation’s road and rail infrastructure along with plans to help our economy bounce back."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (17:36);But before I set out today’s transport announcements, let me briefly remind you of the Government’s Roadmap out of this crisis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (17:44);Can I have the first slide, please? As you know, we’ve established a new COVID alert system with five levels based primarily on the R value and the number of cases. Throughout the lockdown, we’ve been at Level 4. Thanks to the British people, we’ve brought the R down and we can now begin moving carefully to Level 3."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (18:09);Can I have slide two? From this week, we’re at Step 1, that slide. Meaning that those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work. You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as much as you like. You can meet one person who’s not part of your household outside provided you do stay two meters apart."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (18:33);Step 2. From June the 1st at the earliest, and as long as it’s safe, we aim to allow primary schools to reopen for some pupils in smaller class sizes, non-essential retail to start to reopen, and cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors and without crowds."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (18:53);And then, on Step 3, no earlier than July the fourth. And again, only if the data says it’s safe to do so, we aim to allow more businesses to open, including-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (19:03);… we aim to allow more businesses to open, including those offering personal care, those in the leisure sector, together with places of worship."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (19:10);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (19:12);We can control this virus if we stay alert. But what does staying alert actually mean? Staying alert for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible, and working from home if you can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (19:27);But it also means limiting contact with other people, keeping your distance if you go out. Washing your hands regularly, wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant, for example, on public transport. And if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self isolate."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (19:51);Today, I want to update you on the measures we’re taking to speed up our economic recovery while keeping people safe. For two months, we’ve remained locked down, traveling as little as possible. In doing so, the whole country has protected the NHS, and helped reduce the number of COVID infections."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (20:12);But as we begin making tentative steps towards restarting our economy, and people in some sectors who can’t work from home are beginning to return to workplaces, it is clear that transport has a critical role to play."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (20:29);Last Saturday, I explained why it’s our civic duty to avoid public transport if at all possible. Because even when we have 100% of the services up and running, there may only be socially distant space available for one in 10 passengers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (20:46);Therefore, in order to help reduce crowding, we set out a £2 billion program to put cycling and walking at the heart of transport, with £250 million of that emergency money spending already underway."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (21:02);Over the past week, we followed this up by publishing three pieces of detailed guidance. First, for local authorities in England, explaining how they should prepare for significantly increased numbers of both cyclists and pedestrians."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (21:18);Next, for the transport sector, to ensure that they provide safer services for those traveling, and safer workplaces for their staff."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (21:27);Third, and most importantly, for passengers: We’re asking the public to help ensure that the transport system does not become significantly overwhelmed by returning commuters. The guidance makes it clear that if you can’t walk or cycle, but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than traveling by bus, train, or tram, especially where the public transport is liable to be overcrowded."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (21:55);For those people who absolutely need to use public transport, it also explains how you can best protect yourself and those around you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (22:05);In the coming weeks, as we carefully and cautiously restart sectors of our economy, and people begin to travel once again, they should notice that whilst the country has been in downtime with the roads and railways quite quiet, that we have been busy getting on with essential work, fixing the nation’s infrastructure. So we can recover faster when the time comes. This upgrade program, the kind of work that at any other time, would cause inevitable disruption and service delays whilst costing the taxpayer more, has instead carried out in previously unimaginable circumstances of a largely unused transport network."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (22:48);For example, we’ve completed 419 separate network rail projects over Easter, with a further 1,000 upgrades being carried out throughout the May bank holiday. Meanwhile, Highways England has been busy accelerating maintenance projects on the nation’s roads."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (23:07);Last week, for example, we opened the vital A14 upgrade seven months ahead of schedule. This is a route normally used by 85,000 drivers daily, which will dramatically improve access to the UK’s largest container port of Felixstowe, and permanently boost the distribution of goods around the UK. As Northern Powerhouse minister. I can report that in the North we’ve delivered £96 million of rail infrastructure improvements during April. And throughout the country, we’ve accelerated maintenance projects on road and rail whilst always sticking to Public Health England safety guidelines."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (23:49);So that altogether, Highways England has delivered over £200 million of upgrades. Network Rail has delivered £550 million worth during April alone. I’d like to thank the army of transport and construction workers who’ve been grafting very hard throughout this lockdown."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (24:10);But to make sure that Britain is ready to bounce back from coronavirus, today I can announce nearly £2 billion to upgrade our roads and our railways, to put our transport infrastructure in the best possible shape, and to get our economy growing once again."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (24:28);This package includes £1.7 billion for local roads, making journeys smoother and safer for drivers, hauliers, cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and others. By filling millions of dangerous potholes, we can make our roads safer and encourage more people to cycle, or even take part in the upcoming e-scooter trials, helping more people play our part in relieving public pressure on public transport. This investment will help fix damage caused by the winter flooding, repair roads and bridges, and fund numerous road improvement schemes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (25:06);As more people become mobile again, we’ll also be building a network of rapid charging stations for electric cars, including a big expansion of rapid charging facilities, motorway service stations, helping the country to lock in the dramatic air quality improvements we’ve experienced during the coronavirus lockdown. Amid all the sad news and the tragedy of loved ones we’ve lost, we somehow managed to do things in weeks that would normally take years: building new hospitals, moving public services online, making instant reforms and fast-track new laws. Extraordinary changes in the way that employers and employees work, effectively taking swaths of the economy online almost overnight."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (25:55);Now, we want to ensure that we can maintain this momentum. If building a new hospital takes just two weeks, why should building a new road still take as long as 20 years? If GP surgeries can move online, why are most rail passengers still traveling on cardboard tickets? We must exploit our newfound capacity to respond at pace and apply it to rapidly improving our infrastructure."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (26:24);And we must examine why it is that bureaucratic bindweed makes British infrastructure some of the costliest and slowest in Europe to build? Because whilst many will continue to work from home after this crisis, both the long-term transport trend, and the pressing need the communities to level up across the country to take that infrastructure, will be even more important in stimulating our recovery and securing supporting new jobs."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (26:54);By combining fast home internet access with vastly upgraded transport connections, we can help revive many of our small– and medium-sized towns, which over the decades have been left behind."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (27:09);This has been a devastating start to the year. Not just for Britain, but for the world. And we are only at phase one of that recovery plan. But we all know that it is our reaction to adversity that will ultimately define how we recover."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (27:27);We must harness our approach to tackling the pandemic and apply it to rebuilding our own infrastructure with the same swift action, innovation, and collective determination that has characterized us over the past few weeks. And in doing so, we can emerge stronger."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (27:45);I’d like to turn now to Jonathan Van-Tam for the base figures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:50);Thank you, Secretary of State."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:53);Good afternoon to you all. I’m going to go through today’s slides, beginning with some new data. These are social distancing data. They’ve been collected by the Office for National Statistics, and they represent the period from the 24th of April to the 3rd of May this year."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:15);What they show to you quite clearly is that 80% of adults in Great Britain only left their homes for the permitted reasons, if at all. 91% of adults avoided contact with vulnerable people. And compared with 12% last year, 44% of employed adults worked from home in that period."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:40);You can see that there have been very dramatic and very important changes that the British people have made, that have contributed to where we are now in terms of being able to begin easing the social distancing restrictions that we’ve been under for so many weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:59);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (29:03);Now, this slide shows you in a bit more detail testing and new cases across the UK from the period 6th of April on the left of the graphs, through to the 14th of May on the right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (29:17);The top array in pink is testing. Please bear in mind that some people, a very small proportion, will have been tested more than once. But nevertheless, on the 14th of May, 126, 000 tests were performed. This is a new record. It goes on the back of 2.2 million tests delivered in total."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (29:48);In terms of confirmed cases: On the 14th of May, there were 3,446 confirmed cases against a total of 233, 151. If you look carefully at the bottom graph, the green graph, you can now see a gradual downward trend in the number of confirmed cases."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (30:14);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (30:17);These are new data. Again, recently published by the Office for National Statistics, based upon a survey of households that will eventually get to a total size of 10,000 households surveyed. What it shows you are data from the 27th of April through to the 10th of May. These are estimates based upon the sample, but these are estimates for all of England."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (30:46);The estimate is that in that time period, 148,000 people were infected with COVID-19. That is 0.27% of the English population, which is just under three people infected in every 1,000. That is really now quite a low level of infection in the community that is being picked up through this survey."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:17);This survey will be repeated regularly over time. It’s going to be able to show us regional trends and regional data, and the data will feed into the Joint Biosecurity Center to help us keep a very close eye on COVID-19 as we move forwards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:36);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:39);I’m turning now to the data from hospitals. The upper curve shows new daily admissions from the 24th of March through to the 12th of May. The bottom curve shows the percentage of critical care beds occupied by COVID- 19 patients. There are four traces they’re covering the five traces … I beg your pardon, covering four traces covering the four nations of the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (32:14);What you can see on both of those slides are now long, steady declines in admissions and the proportion of critical care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients. This is clearly extremely good news, and shows that the pressure on hospitals is now beginning to ease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (32:37);Over the page, please. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (32:40);This further data shows the total number of people in hospital with COVID-19 across the UK. The general pattern across the UK, you can see now, is clearly downwards. There’s been a 14% drop in the total number of people in hospital since last week. Again, this is moving in the right direction."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:04);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:08);This slide sadly shows deaths due to COVID-19, confirmed with a positive test right across the UK, beginning at the 14th of March on the left of the slide, and moving to the 14th of May. There have been 428 deaths with a confirmed test reported on the 14th of May."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:32);But as importantly now, if you look at the slide itself and look at the yellow curve, picking out the seven-day rolling average, this decline is now continuing. And it is sustained, which again is a very positive sign indeed. Thank you, sir."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (33:52);Thank you very much, Jonathan. We turn now to questions first from the members of the public. Helen from Cheshire."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Helen: (34:00);My son is due to start the final year of his engineering degree at Durham in October, which cannot be done purely online. He has to start paying rent on his student house in July, and take out the student loan of £9,250 in August. If lectures move online, he will be thousands of pounds worse off, and will also miss out on the student experience."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Helen: (34:23);There was no mention of students or universities in the government’s plan to rebuild on Monday. What is the government’s plan for students and universities this autumn? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (34:34);Well Helen, thank you very much. We certainly share an interest. I also have a son at university, wondering about exactly the same issues. That, of course, comes down to what happens with the pace from the charts that the professor was just showing us of the decline in this disease. Of course, it will be the case that if we can get those numbers down, then different parts of the economy will start to be able to reopen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (34:59);I think it’s too early to say, but the education secretary will be returning to the subject, and will be providing us all with further guidance. Like you, Helen, I’m very interested to hear it when it comes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (35:14);There is something we can all do in the meantime, which is when we say “Stay alert,” ensure that we do have that social distancing in place, particularly as some of the tentative first baby steps in unlock start to happen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (35:28);I think it is a wait and see, but we’re absolutely aware of the concerns. And we want to make sure that we beat this virus in a way that can allow parts of society, including education, higher and further education, to get going again."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (35:42);Can I turn to a nanny from Farmbrook? This is going to be a written question. “Millions of people have had their operations and other hospital procedures postponed indefinitely. Can the government say when elective surgery and other delayed treatments will recommence?”"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (35:57);Well, yes, Nanny, it’s definitely the case that we want the NHS, which as Jonathan was just demonstrating, has capacity increasingly coming back into it, because the number of people in hospital for COVID has been coming down, to be able to take up routine operations, many of which haven’t stopped. But some of which I know that the health secretary has referred to specifically. He’ll be saying more about that soon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (36:24);I don’t know, Jonathan, is there anything that you wanted to add from a medical point of view?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:28);Only really to say that we absolutely understand that the National Health Service is not a COVID treatment service. It has had to focus on that in the last few months, but we’re very conscious. Everybody in Health is conscious of the fact that as soon as is physically and humanly possible, services must be restored to normal. But that takes time, and it has to be done at a paced, measured, safe way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (36:56);[inaudible 00:36:56] it is worth noting that at no time has the NHS become overwhelmed. We’ve got the Nightingale hospitals, we’ve managed to increase the capacity, and the NHS has done a phenomenal job of that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (37:09);As Jonathan rightly says, we want to make sure that it is there for everything. We also encourage people to continue contacting their GP or dialing 111 to make sure that they’re getting the support that they require from the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (37:23);Can we turn now to questions from the media? Alison Holt at the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Alison Holt: (37:28);Secretary of State, there’s growing anger amongst people within the care sector about what they see as the ongoing slowness of the government’s response to their needs, their problems."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Alison Holt: (37:40);They are still waiting for instance, for details of the infection control plan that was announced yesterday, it’s two months into the pandemic. What would you say to reassure them that this is going to change?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Alison Holt: (37:52);Also a question from my sports colleagues for Professor Van-Tam. You’ve been involved in talks with Premier League players. How likely is it to be safe enough to return to …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Allison: (38:03);How likely is it to be safe enough to return to competitive football by June the 12th?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (38:08);Allison, thank you very much, indeed. Look, with care homes they are actually specialists in infection control. That’s something that care homes, I understand, often routinely are the frontline of handling, often more so than hospitals, and many of them, well, all of them, will be knowing exactly what to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (38:28);And Testament to that is that in the majority, the vast majority, of care homes, COVID-19 hasn’t been reported at all. However, it certainly is the case, and we’ve seen these figures from the WHO, who say that in Europe, as a whole, over 50% of deaths have taken place in care homes, not so in English care homes, the figures being about 25% overall, but it is absolutely essential that they are provided with every provision."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (38:59);I just want to give you an example of that. Care homes often privately owned, are actually always buying their own PPE. That’s how it’s always worked. The government stepped in very quickly to, although as you know, well covered, massive global shortage, help to provide PPE to care home with millions of pieces delivered."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (39:20);So there’s been a big national effort to assist them, and I know that the Health Secretary will be saying more about that soon. But I don’t want to underestimate the extraordinary work that’s gone in to care homes to make sure that most of them have indeed remained COVID free in the meantime as well. I’ll go to Jonathan now, if you’d like to comment on football."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (39:45);Yes, on football. As you now, the overall approach with easing social distancing has been one that has been tentative, measured, slow, and stepwise. And that is exactly the plan that is underway for all of the elite sport, not just football. That there will be small, carefully measured stepwise approaches to seeing what can be achieved safely."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (40:16);The first of those is really to return to safe training, still observing social distancing. And measures are taking place, plans are taking place, at quite some depth to be ready to do that. And that will be a stepwise thing. We will have to see how that goes before it is time to move on, or even think about moving on, to the return of competitive football matches, as you have outlined in your question. So I think we have to be slow. We have to be measured."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (40:56);Allison, I’m just going to give you the opportunity to come back on either those."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Allison: (40:59);Yes, if I could, one more question on care homes and the care sector. In Scotland, care home residents that have tested COVID positive will now have to have two negative tests before they can return to that care home. Is that something that’s going to be introduced in England?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (41:16);It’s probably more a question for the medical experts and Public Health England than me., I did just want to mention in regard to testing though, that it’s important to know that everybody in a care home, that doesn’t matter whether that is a care home worker or resident, and doesn’t matter whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, can now be tested. And there are different routes to testing. One of which is there are now 116, is the latest figure, 116 mobile testing units, which can actually physically as required, or if required, go to a care home as well, which is helpful to know. But I think on the detail what the medical advice would be, again, I’ll turn to the professor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (41:58);Yeah. So I’ll just say there’s an absolutely enormous effort now to increase the amount of daily tests performed in care homes. And testing is part of the discharge process before patients are discharged from NHS facilities to care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (42:17);Jonathan, thank you very much, indeed. I’ll turn now to Tom Clark at ITV. Tom."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Tom Clark: (42:22);Thank you, Secretary of State. My question relates to antibody tests that have been in the headlines today. The Prime Minister described antibody tests as game changing. is that still the government’s position? And if so, when can we expect to see the game changing potential actually deployed in this epidemic? And how are you going to prioritize those? Will they go straight to care homes or frontline healthcare and care workers first?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (42:48);Thanks Tom. Look, I think, first of all, I’ll hand over to Jonathan for the medical side of this, but I think it’s very exciting that there’s a very reliable, possibly even a 100% reliable, antibody test. That’s the test, of course, that shows whether or not you’ve actually had coronavirus in the past rather than currently, and have therefore developed the antibodies. It’s very good news, particularly if it transpires that this makes you immune, at least for a period, from getting coronavirus again. And I think therein is the question mark within your question. I’ll come back to you after this, but I’m going to ask Professor Jonathan Van-Tam just to address that point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (43:30);So thank you for the question. You’re absolutely right. We have been waiting for a really good antibody test to be ready. There are now at least two available. One of those has received its CE mark on the 28th of April, the Rosch Test. It has been validated by Public Health England on the 7th of May. And I anticipate that it will be rapidly rolled out in the days and weeks to come, as soon as it is practical to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (44:02);I also anticipate that the focus will be on the National Health Service and on carers in the first instance. And it has taken time. What we required was a test that was highly specific. And to explain to people what that means, it means that the chances of a false positive are extremely low with this test. And I’m sure you can understand that if we had used a test where it was possible of giving a false positive result and therefore saying to people, you have antibodies to COVID-19 when in fact you don’t, that would have been very undesirable indeed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (44:46);So absolutely this is a good test that will stand us in good stead moving forwards, and I think it will be incredibly important as the days, weeks and months go by. Now, there are some science pieces that need to go along with that, and please remember that this is a virus that emerged in December. So the totality of human learning on this virus has been in the last five months. That’s not long to get to know all the ins and outs of a virus. And one of the things that we’ve needed to know is after infection and recovery, whether there is an antibody response. And it’s clear that in most cases there is, but you can’t just apply this test. You have to wait at least 14 days, preferably 28 days, after the infection in order to be sure to pick up the antibodies if they are there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (45:50);The next thing to say is, it’s going to take us time to understand whether the antibodies in all cases protect against infection and you can’t speed up the answer to that. You have to carefully study people who have recovered, people who you know have got antibodies, and follow them, and track them, and see if they become reinfected. And over time, hopefully, you get the answer that they’re not, but that is data that has to be gathered over time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (46:23);And then finally, if you understand that antibodies do protect you against re-infection from this disease, the final science question is how long into the future do the antibodies last for? It is not automatic that by any means that these are going to be lifelong. We just don’t know. We’ll have to take people with antibodies and measure them over time to understand how long the antibodies stay in the body. And that is something that I’m afraid scientists all around the world have to be patient about and have to wait for the answers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (47:04);Now, those answers may come from other parts of the world. They may come from the UK, where there’s enormous efforts being put into what we call long term serology surveys to understand all of this. But it isn’t something that you can compress through time in a science sense, no matter how hard you try, we just have to learn as we go along. But the good news is we do now have antibody tests that we absolutely can rely on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (47:34);Thank you very much, Jonathan. So, Tom, I think to answer your question, if all of those things end up being, yes, and it actually provides that immunity, then for sure it would be game changing because it would enable us to do things in terms of releasing lockdowns That wouldn’t be possible otherwise."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (47:50);I think your second part of your question was about quantity. I don’t know the exact answer to that. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions will be the answer, I’m sure, but it’s a very positive development and we’re delighted that it’s happened. Did you want to come back at all, Tom?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Tom Clark: (48:06);May I be committed to just one follow up? Yes. Just as I understand it, there are other tests, and Professor Van-Tam just eluded to that, not just Roche. I believe Abbott Laboratories have an effective antibody test as well. I’m getting the impression the government is doing a deal with Rosch. Are we having an exclusive relationship here, or are we going to try and spread our bets, given the uncertainties that still remain in terms of this [inaudible 00:48:30]?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Tom Clark: (48:30);And secondly, have these tests been validated against people with very low levels antibodies, these asymptomatic cases, because that’s the game changing element, is how many people out there have actually had COVID-19 and we won’t know that. We can’t spot people with asymptomatic [crosstalk 00:10:47]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (48:45);So on that second point, I know the tests were carried out at Porton Down by PHE. Jonathan may know more about it. On the first point, of course we’ll want to get as many tests as possible. We’ve never restricted ourselves with that regard. And we’ve looked at other antibody tests before this, which actually just didn’t stack up once we tested them, including some very early on. Unless you have that 100% accuracy, they’re not helpful in individual cases. Though, I think it is true to say that you can have less than 100% accuracy and come up with a useful survey of a wider percentage and come up with statistically useful information. It’s not the same as having what appears to be there now. And so I think these questions we’ll have to wait and see the answer. I don’t know if you wanted to add anything on the testing side of things."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (49:39);Well, so, on the contracting point, doctors aren’t told that kind of thing and I’m sure I couldn’t talk about it anyway, because it’s undoubtedly commercially sensitive. I’m an epidemiologist, not a laboratory scientist, so I think the question you’re asking is, is there a threshold below which the tests cannot pick up a very faint signal? And I don’t know the answer to that. I think the Secretary of State is right, that does not change their value in understanding what is going on in the British population, and how many of us have now been exposed to this disease, been infected, even if we may not have known it at the time, and now have antibodies. And that’s going to be a critical piece of understanding as we go forward, because we’re going to have to live with this virus for quite some time, certainly until a vaccine comes along."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (50:32);Tom, thanks very much. It’s a fascinating and extremely important, and actually quite hopeful area, given the news on that antibody today. I’d like to turn now to Charlotte Ivers of talkRADIO."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Charlotte Ivers: (50:45);Thank you, Secretary of State. NHS England were due to publish some data today on the number of urgent operations canceled in March 2020. That data release has itself been canceled and I’m quoting from the gov.uk website here, it says “These statistics will not be collected and published for the period due to the coronavirus illness and due to release capacity across the NHS.” So can we be absolutely clear here? Does the government know how many urgent operations were canceled in March 2020?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (51:25);Thanks very much, Charlotte. Simple answer, I don’t know the answer to that. It is the case that in all these situations, we’re trying to get data out as much as possible, both as a government. We found that to be a useful process, to just put data out there so people can analyze it. But also of course, people like the Office of National Statistics, who look after the nation’s statistics, and the NHS, who have a very big statistics function."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (51:53);I guess from your description, it’s the first I’ve heard about it, but I guess from your description, it is just a prioritization issue. And actually, with your permission, I’ll ask the Health Secretary when I speak to him and make sure we specifically get you an answer to your question. Unless Jonathan knows anything off the top of his head."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (52:13);I don’t have the answer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (52:14);I’m afraid I don’t know enough about the way that the statistics are delivered within the NHS to answer the question. I’ll just give you a chance to come back to Charlotte, in case you’ve got to follow up on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Charlotte Ivers: (52:24);Absolutely. I think yes, from what’s on the gov.uk website, it does seem to be a case of prioritization, but obviously these are urgent operations and therefore I’m surprised to see the government hasn’t taken it as a priority to assess how many have actually been canceled."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (52:42);And so Charlotte, what I can certainly take tell you is I will check in with the Health Secretary immediately after this, and we’ll find out what we know about it. It will, as you rightly say, possibly be a question of prioritization, or, as in other cases during coronavirus, the NHS having to put its resources elsewhere in order to get things going. That said, I’d be surprised if we haven’t got a pretty firm knowledge on the number of operations. I do see statistics mentioned mostly by the media on this all the time. Let’s find out the answer for you and you can rebroadcast it. Thank you very much, indeed. Thank you for the question. Can O turn to Jim Picard of the FT. Jim."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jim Picard: (53:24);Secretary of State, back in March, you bailed out almost the insider railway industry. The transport for London is running out of money fast, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor, has said that they’re basically hours away from some major cash crunch. I understand you’re close to some rescue deal for them, but they’re saying that they need money, not just for the spring, the summer, the autumn, but they need money possibly for several years. If social distancing is to remain on the tube and on London buses, is that something that you can commit to?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jim Picard: (53:54);And my second question for Professor Van-Tam, the government has drawn up plans to introduce quarantine for people coming to the UK from anywhere in the world to two weeks, but under one proposal, France would be excluded, as a scientist, do you think there’s any scientific rationale for that idea of excluding the French?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (54:16);Jim, thanks very much. Look on TFL, and actually this applies wider across our entire network. As you point out, right at the beginning of this crisis, we had a rescue package for all of the railways. We subsequently also helped the bus companies, trams, ferries, and many others, to work through this crisis. Not least to ensure that critical workers were able to get to places like the NHS and social care, and all the other important work that’s been going on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (54:44);We are now in a situation where I am optimistic of having a solution with TFL and the mayor of London. We don’t know the answer to the second part of your question there, which is, well, what would happen if this lasted for very much longer, and it went on for more than a few months? Of course, we’re all working to make sure that we get rid of the virus, or get rid of it as much as possible, which is why I think the data that Professor Jonathan Van-Tam was just showing was so good to see, that the number of infections seemed to be coming down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (55:25);But we don’t know what the longterm will be. However, I am confident in the short term, TFL, London underground, and the buses, and indeed the trains and buses throughout the rest of the country, will continue to run. And I’m encouraging the mayor to make sure we get that back to 100% very quickly, as people are starting to travel more. It’s very important, as I was saying in my comments earlier, that we do not have overcrowding. And then I think there’s a question on the epidemiology of 14 days isolation. [crosstalk 00:17:53]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (55:53);So thank you for the question about quarantine. As I understand it, discussions are still ongoing about what the final shape of measures at the UK borders will look like. And that’s not for me to comment while those discussions are still going on. But you asked a question about the science and about quarantine making sense. Given that the incubation period of this illness is up to 14 days, then asking people who cross the UK border to stay at home for 14 days to self isolate, means that they can’t develop symptoms or become infectious just before the development of symptoms and be out there at large in our community. So that’s scientifically very important."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (56:43);And where quarantine and when quarantine makes most sense, scientifically, is when the incidence, the level of disease, the level of new cases, in the receiving country, in this case, the UK, is low and it makes most sense in terms…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (57:03);… is low, and it makes most sense in terms of travelers coming from areas where the incidence is high."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (57:09);Jim, do you want to come back on either of those points?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jim: (57:12);Just on that on the TFL point, are you expecting the mayor to introduce higher fares as part of the rescue package? And do I understand it, Professor Van-Tam, that you’re saying that because we have a higher infection rate than France, then that’s not really a problem? In which case, why wouldn’t we apply the same rule to other countries with a lower infection rate?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (57:33);On the first point, and I can actually comment on the second one if you like as well. On higher fares, look, it’s very important I think in providing a rescue package for TFL that the London mayor can work with that we don’t end up in a situation where people from outside the capital are unfairly carrying the burden. By which, I mean, sadly, I have to stand up and do them each year, fares do end up having to rise with inflation. Otherwise, everyone knows there’s less money going into the system. If you have consistent fair freezes, it means that more money isn’t going into the system, and you can’t then have an unfair settlement where other British taxpayers are effectively bailing out the system, albeit that the system in this case is in trouble because clearly of coronavirus. So there is the right balance to be made to answer your question head on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (58:28);In terms of the 14 days and what happens at our borders, to pick up on your last point, which is probably better aimed at me, but we’re working on the detail of this. Let’s wait til we’ve seen it. As a principal though, it seems fair and right that if we’re asking the British people to stay at home and make such huge sacrifices in their own lives, then we would expect anybody coming back to the country to do the same thing or visiting the country to do the same thing with some limited exceptions. For the reasons that Jonathan was explaining, it makes sense to do that as our own level of infections come under control, not to effectively reimport it. Of course now, we have things like the testing and tracking capacity to do that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (59:13);It’s worth mentioning actually that in terms of the testing and tracking app, I know that the health secretary will say more about it shortly, but there are now over half the residents of the Isle of Wight where this is being tested out, who have downloaded the tracking app for the first time. In total rather, the actual number is 72,300, which means that over half of Isle of Wight have downloaded that. One of the things we’ll be asking people to do at the border when they come in is to download the app and provide us with contact details so that we know where people are. I think this a very sensible, proportionate approach to making sure we don’t reimport a problem once we’ve got these numbers under control, particularly now we have that test and tracking capability, which wouldn’t have existed some time ago. Jim, thank you very much, indeed. I’m going to turn to John Stevens of the Daily Mail. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","John Stevens: (01:00:05);Thank you, transport secretary. You’re asking people to use cars instead of public transport. Aside from road upgrades that are likely to take some time, what are you going to do to help motorists now? Could local councils be asked to scrap parking charges or get rid of parking restrictions? Could people get help to buy a car?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (01:00:25);Thanks, John. First of all, it is an unusual situation for a transport secretary to be in to actively ask people to avoid, particularly busy times or actually at busy times, public transport. It’s very, very important that we get this right, otherwise that would become a major way to spread the disease if people can’t maintain social distancing. So, yes, the car, if you can’t use other active forms of transport like cycling or walking, then the car is certainly the option that comes about. One of the things, as I mentioned in my opening comments, that we’ve enjoyed during, one of the few things that’s been better during the lockdown has been the air quality, which has gone up dramatically. We want to maintain some of that, so incentives for people to over time switch to electric vehicles, the money that I announced both on Saturday when I spoke from here but also today for upgrading electric charging, is really important, because it helps people feel comfortable and not experience range anxiety if they get an electric car, which helps. But also in terms of cars, the pothole work has been going on throughout, but there will be an expansion of that to fix our roads to make it better for drivers. Of course, fuel charges have come down. The cost of petrol has come down quite a lot during this crisis. You’re right about the balance of parking charges and different zones, because there are times now where we’re literally encouraging people to drive perhaps close to but maybe not right into perhaps a town or city that they work in and find a place to park. We’re working not just with local authorities on this, John, but also with some large entertainment venues who have car parks, which aren’t being used at the moment, and looking at all those possibilities, so it’s a very good point. I’ll just come back to you, John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","John Stevens: (01:02:17);Yeah. I just wanted to ask you a quick question about holidays. When the hospitality industry is allowed to start opening up again, do you think holidays outside such as camping or caravaning could be seen as carrying less risk than staying in hotels, and could they be allowed to open sooner?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (01:02:34);Well, I’ll certainly ask Jonathan to answer part of that, but on the broader point, just so we’re clear where we are today and where we hope we’re heading. Today, although you can now travel any distance, for example, to go and exercise, you must still stay in your own home at night, so you can’t, at the moment, book holiday accommodation or bed and breakfast or stay over anywhere. But over a period of time, and I set out in that slide earlier phases one, two and three, we are saying that we will look to unlock if the data says it’s possible. If not, we’ll have to stop, I’m afraid. But if we can, we’ll unlock, and at that point, my impression is that outdoors actually, as things stand at the moment, is a lesser risk than indoors, but right now I’m going to stop and defer to an expert professor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (01:03:22);Yes, thank you. The two epidemiological concepts that are important in keeping the infection rate down is staying within household groups and minimizing the contact between households. That’s one point. It is absolutely an area of biological truism that outdoor environments are much less risk than indoor environments, but, of course, that will need some careful thinking about, because sharing a tent is a small enclosed space or can be a small enclosed space with generally poor conditions of ventilation, and I guess it depends who you’re sharing it with. Same for a caravan. So it’s not as straightforward as it might sound, indoors, outdoors, hotels, campsites. It’s a little more complex than that, and it will take some careful thought. Now you’ve mentioned it, I’ll begin to give that a bit of careful thought."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (01:04:25);Thank you very much, Jonathan, and thank you, John, and actually also your readers for their tremendous work on PPE and the campaign that you’ve been running, which has been greatly appreciated. Can I turn to William Telford from Plymouth Life? William."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","William Telford: (01:04:41);Good afternoon. I’d like to ask her the secretary of state a couple of questions specific to Plymouth and following up on the last question on the hospitality industry. I don’t know how much you know about Plymouth, but 2020 was set to be a very big year for us with the Mayflower 400 celebrations. Those have all now being postponed. The city has suffered a 71 million pound loss in tourism in just the time of the pandemic. It’s lost 20 million pounds from loss of student revenue, and the city council is saying it is now set to lose 50 million pounds from lost income and increased costs. This puts our economy of this city somewhat a state of jeopardy."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","William Telford: (01:05:29);It’s a city that already has some of the worst deprivation areas in the southwest if not the whole country and a history of underfunding, so I wonder if the secretary of state can tell us, is there anything you can do or are planning to do to specifically help cities such as Plymouth that have unique problems? Secondly, in light of what the French prime minister said today about restarting domestic holidays in from July and August and bearing in mind the problems we’ve got with the hospitality sector here, could we expect a similarly clear announcement before July the 4th, and will there be any sort of support package expressly for hospitality?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (01:06:13);Thank you very much, indeed, for those questions, William. I think Plymouth is actually, like many areas, experiencing the worst of the coronavirus. It’s clearly decimated things like planned celebrations, and I was aware of the one that was planned for this year. I did check before seeing you were coming on, and I know that the government’s business support package in Plymouth has allocated 47 million pounds to Plymouth, and has also paid over 3,200 grants totalling over 39 million pounds to organizations there. Also, you will recall from other ministers saying it, we’re allocating 3.2 billion pounds of additional funding to local governments, and I make that point to address your wider issue of towns and places like Plymouth, cities like Plymouth to respond to the coronavirus, of which Plymouth has received 15.7 million pounds of that money to date."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Grant Shapps: (01:07:15);On your second point, look, France, as I was talking to my opposite at number last night, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, and we were having this discussion. France is probably two or three weeks ahead of where the UK was … I’ll check this with Jonathan … into this virus, into the crisis, so they’ve been making decisions at every stage a little bit ahead of us. It’s unknown, because we will want to get through those phases that I described on the slide before. We know that these things can’t come before. We’ve said not before July the 4th, phase three, which opens a much wider potential, but we do need to make sure that the R rate and the number of cases in the community and in society, it is a level where we can unlock before we can do that. Just because it’s an epidemiological question, I’ll also throw it over to Johnathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-14","Jonathan Van-Tam: (01:08:14);I don’t think I’ve really much to add other than that the landmass in France is clearly larger for a fairly similar population size, and population density is going to be much less in France as a whole outside of the cities, and that undoubtedly is the kind of difference that will need to be thought about very carefully before making too many international comparisons."

That brings us to the end of our questions. I was just going to wrap up by saying it is clearly important, if we want to, as so many of those questions request, to get to the next phases and unlock other parts of the economy, that we all continue to stay alert. Staying alert means remembering to go back to all the things that we were being told about at the beginning, like washing your hands, carrying hand sanitizer, and making sure that you stay two meters apart, and if you or anybody else in your household is ill, please remember to stay isolated and at home for 14 days. Thank you very much. Thank you too, Jonathan. Thanks for today. (silence)."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (00:04);Good afternoon, and welcome to Downing Street for the daily Coronavirus briefing. I’m joined by the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, and by NHS England’s medical director for primary care doctor Nikki Kanani. First, I want to take this chance to update you on the latest Coronavirus data. 2,353,078 tests for Coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 133,784 tests yesterday. 236,711 people have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 3,560 since yesterday. 10,024 people are currently in hospital with Coronavirus. This is a 13% fall from the same time last week, and very sadly of those who’ve tested positive across all settings 33,998 people have now died. That’s an increase of 384 since yesterday, and we mourn each one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (01:17);The number of deaths is falling each day in all settings, thankfully, and we are past the peak of this virus, and I just want to take a moment to remind everyone about our plans for this second phase. If we have slide one please. We’ve set up the new COVID Alert Level system, that’s the five levels of threat based on the R value and the number of new cases. The alert level intern guides the social distancing rules, which are vital in our efforts to control the virus. A higher alert level means stricter rules. Throughout the lockdown we’ve been at level four, which means that COVID-19 is in general circulation, and transmission is high, or rising exponentially, but thanks to your shared sacrifice, we’ve brought R down cautiously, and carefully, and responsibly. We’re now in a position to start moving to level three."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (02:20);If we could get to the next slide, please. We’ve set out the first of the three steps that we’ll take carefully to modify the social distancing rules, and start to restore freedom to this country, all the while avoiding a disastrous second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. At each step we’ll closely monitor the impact on R, on the number of new infections, and on, of course, all available data, and we’ll only move to the next step when we judge it’s safe to do so. In the first step as of this week, if you work, but can’t work from home, you should speak to your employer about going back in. People can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like, and you can meet one other person from outside your household in an outdoor public place, but please keep two meters apart."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (03:16);This weekend with the good weather, and the new rules I hope people can enjoy being outside, but please stick with the rules. Keep an eye on your family, and don’t take risks. Next slide please. We’ve also updated what we’re asking people to do, which is to stay alert, control the virus, and save lives. For the vast majority of people staying alert still means staying at home as much as is possible, working from home when you can, limiting contact with people, keeping your distance if you go out, two meters, wherever possible, washing your hands regularly. This is still the single most effective thing that you can do to keep yourself safe, and of course, self isolating, if you or anyone in your household has Coronavirus symptoms."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (04:08);By staying alert and following the rules, you can play a part in the national effort, getting R down and keeping R down, controlling the virus so that we can save lives, rebuild livelihoods, and start to recover our freedom as a nation. From the start of this crisis across the world, because this disease has a bigger impact on the elderly, there’s been a huge need to protect people in care homes. We’ve worked to do this in this country right from the start of the crisis. This morning’s information from the ONS once again reminds us that care homes do so much to look after our most vulnerable people in their frailty towards the end of their life. Many of you watching this will have a loved one in a care home as I do, and I know how worrying it’s been."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (05:06);I want to tell you what we’ve been doing to protect people in care homes throughout the crisis. If we start with the data, in April 31,203 people died in care homes, of whom 11,560 died with Coronavirus. I’m grateful to the ONS for having responded to the requests to put extra resources into understanding, and measuring all this. Right from the start it’s been clear that this horrible virus affects older people most. Right from the start, we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes. We set out our first advice in February, and as the virus grew, we strengthened it throughout. We’ve made sure that care homes have the resources they need to control the spread of infection. Social care is a devolved matter of course, and this week we’ve made a further 600 million pounds available to care homes in England. This comes on top of the 3.2 billion we made available in March, and April, and the 712 million pounds we’ve made available to the devolved authorities, that’s 369 million extra for Scotland, 223 million extra for Wales, and 124 million for Northern Ireland."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (06:28);We’ve put extra infection control procedures in place, and prioritized testing in care homes. We test any resident returning to a care home from hospital, and all residents with symptoms, and all social care colleagues, and members of their households if they have symptoms. Together, these measures have saved lives, and protected 64% of care homes, almost two thirds from having any Coronavirus cases at all, and where there are cases we’ve taken extra measures to protect residents and staff with local public health officials playing such a critical role. Now we have capacity for well over a hundred thousand tests a day. We’re extending testing coverage still further. All care home residents, and staff in England, both of those with symptoms, and those without are now being tested."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (07:22);In fact, we’ll test every resident, and every member of staff in our elderly care homes in England between now and early June. To get those tests to where they need to be, we’ve set up an easy to use digital service on gov.uk, allowing care home managers to apply online for the testing kids. Next, we’ve strengthened the NHS support available to colleagues in social care, and this is what Nikki is here to talk about today. Throughout the NHS has been supporting care homes with infection control training, and advice, and support on, for instance, PPE usage. We’re putting in place a named clinical lead for every care home in England. These leads are already connected, and we’ll check in regularly to assess residents and support care home staff with clinical advice. This is the most intense support and scrutiny that care homes have ever received."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (08:19);In some cases for residents who need to see a GP, a video consultation may be safer and just as effective, so the NHS is also supporting care homes to introduce the right technology. This same technology can, and is being used to be able to help residents stay connected to their loved ones, something I know is important, both for their wellbeing and for ours. Third, we’re making sure local authorities play their part. We’re now requiring councils to conduct daily reviews of the situation on the ground in local care homes. These reviews ensure that every care home gets the support they need every single day, and we’re requiring care homes to ensure the flow of timely and accurate care home data, so local and national government can support, and where necessary challenge, and act if that’s what’s needed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (09:12);As a result of all this, and the work of so many people across the social care system, and across the NHS, and across local government, two thirds of England’s care homes have had no outbreak at all. The number of care homes reporting their first case each day has fallen from a peak of 219 to 59. I’m glad to report that since the peak, the number of COVID-19 deaths of people in care homes has halved, but whilst this is progress, there is so much more to do, and this crisis has also demonstrated the imperative for reform. It’s shown the importance of long standing calls for closer working between health and social care. It’s acted as a catalyst for integration and shown the benefits of it on the ground. Information support mutual understanding between health and social care are flowing better than ever before, helping to break down some historic barriers despite the system, not because of it, and my view is that health and social care have a common mission to care for people, but too often in the past bureaucracy has held them apart. From the start, we’ve worked incredibly hard to throw that protective ring around our care homes. Yes, it has been difficult. These viruses reserve their full cruelty for those who are physically weakest, the elderly, the frail, and the already sick. All those who most rely on human contact. People who live in care homes are amongst our most vulnerable citizens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (10:53);We’ll do everything humanly possible to protect them for as long as they are threatened by this virus, and thanks to the collective efforts of everyone watching we have passed through the peak, but there is still a long road ahead, so stay alert, control the virus, and save lives. If Jenny can now take us through the rest of the daily data."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (11:18);Next line please, thank you. Today we are hearing a lot about the R number. It’s important that the public can see that. For the first time this afternoon we’re publishing the R number. We want to keep this below one, and as you can see R is the average number of additional people infected, so while it’s one pandemic and epidemic in this country will stay flat. If it goes above that number, we will start to see an increasing number of cases, and we may experience the second peak. It’s really important that we keep monitoring it. Having said that you can see that there’s quite a range there, an 0.7 to one in the estimate of R, and this is for a number of reasons, partly because a number of different models are used to model this data, and it’s important that they challenge each other, and that we get the consistency of that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (12:12);Partly the data comes from historic data. We obviously can’t predict precisely, so we’re estimating it on different sources of information, so things like hospital admissions that have happened historically, and then, I think, thirdly, importantly, we know that we have slightly different R values relating to some areas of risk. Obviously, in recent weeks care homes have been heightened interest, hospitals also, and we keep an eye on those. This is very much a national average, but it’s quite likely in the community across the country that where people have been working really hard on the social distancing measures, that our value will be lower. This is an average across the country, and on the left hand side you can see it’s important that we take the R value in the context of…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (13:03);… the case numbers that we’re seeing across the country and from the ONS survey, which is a community survey conducted in people’s homes on the longitudinal basis. So sequentially, the average proportion of the community in England that had COVID was 0.27%, upper limit of that, about 0.4. So a maximum of about one in 400 people. And then right across the country, therefore in England, a broad estimate of around 148,000 people with COVID at any time. So that’s coming down. Next slide, please. So the data on the left is from Google mobility data. Obviously, there’s a little bit, we can’t control exactly who’s uploading that, but it gives us a pretty good indication of people’s movements."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (13:55);And you can see that early March, people were moving as normal and we’ve seen a significant drop off as social distancing measures have come in. That’s continued to be maintained so people are only going out in the main for permitted activities. So some people going to work as permitted, but many staying at home. Going out for grocery and pharmacy, which are essential visits, and then a rise in the use of parks coming forward now. And we anticipate that within social distancing measures, that will increase. And on the right hand side, you can see the ONS opinion’s in lifestyle survey. And that shows that 44% of employed adults are actually working from home compared to 12% last year. This is a change in habit, and we’re expecting that people will maintain that and advising that they should."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (14:48);And it’s probably going to be a successful way forward for us to control many of the social distancing measures over the next few months. 80% of adults only left home for those permitted reasons that we can see on the left and 91% of adults have avoided contact with vulnerable people. So everybody is trying to keep each other and our vulnerable people safe. Next slide, please. Here we can see the slide which represents current situation with testing. So 133,784 tests were completed up to nine o’clock on the 15th of May. So this includes lab tests, those were posted out under satellite testing, and you can see the rise there going forward on the top chart at the right. So we’re heading towards two and a half million tests in total now, and we’ve had 3,560 cases confirmed over the last 24 hours, which brings the UK total to 236,711."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (15:51);And the graph on the bottom left, despite that increasing testing and therefore the likelihood of finding new cases is continuing to come down. Next slide, please. This shows our data from hospitals. So the estimated emissions with COVID in hospital is now down to 910, on the 13th of May. So that’s down from over 1,000 the week before. And the graph obviously on the right is showing that clearly, the downward trend on the graph is down, but it’s slow and careful, and therefore we need to maintain our social distancing measures. But the biggest concern or one of the big concerns right at the start of the epidemic in the country was about critical care bed capacity. And in fact, only 19% of our critical care beds are occupied now with COVID-19 patients. And that pattern is replicated across all critical care usage in the UK. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (16:54);Here, we can see people in hospital and the geographical distribution. And I think on the bottom right hand side, where London has had a severe and sharper rise in the number of cases in a highly densely populated area, that has come down now. Other parts of the country are seeing a slightly different shape to their epidemic… Which for us, these are across all our settings, not just the hospital settings. But again, you can see that the rolling average, which is a better measure as the deaths are reported at different times shows that those deaths are steadily decreasing, which is obviously good news and we need to keep our social distancing going."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (18:18);Thank you very much, indeed. Questions. Firstly, from the public, we have Susanna from Oxford."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Susanna: (18:28);The government’s COVID alert level one is eradication in the UK. Is this a realistic policy target?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (18:37);Well, that is a great question. And Jenny, as the scientist and epidemiologist, you’re best place to answer it, I think."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (18:45);Thank you. So it’s an ambitious target, I think, but then I think if we’re dealing with something as serious as COVID, we want to be ambitious. You may be referring to the WHO announcements over the last few days where I think the reality of COVID, in global terms, not just in the UK, was put forward. And I think it’s fair to say, there isn’t an immediate easy outcome to this to get us to level one. Smallpox is the only infectious disease where we have actually eradicated a disease. But of course, there is an example there. So I think having that ambition is good. The key things, obviously, that we need to drive this forward in the longterm are understanding the immunities, and not just understanding our antibody response, but what that means in terms of maintaining immunity in a population over time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (19:39);And obviously treatments in the short term for treating people, but to eradicate it, we really need vaccine as well. So all of those programs are ongoing, but clearly the immediate effort is to reduce the number of cases that we have and to ensure that we dampen down the epidemic in the UK, and that’s what we’re doing at the moment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (20:00);Thank you very much, indeed. Next question, which has been sent in by Anna from Worthing. Anna from Worthing asks, “After many years of waiting for a pay rise, nurses are frustrated and feel very devalued due to a neverending unrecognized financial pay they deserve. Would this crisis be a strong evidence for the government to finally recognize that nursing is a highly skilled profession and it deserves decent pay?” Well, I think I’m best placed to answer this one, Anna, and I agree very strongly that nursing is a highly skilled profession and deserves decent pay. And we put up nurses’ pay last month and in fact, last year, we had the fastest rise, the biggest rise in the pay, especially for nurses when they’re starting their career and the lowest paid nurses who got a pay rise very significant of over 15%. So there has been a significant pay rise for nurses and I think one of the things the crisis has shown is just how much the nation values our staff across the health and care system, including nurses, and when it comes to how we reward people for their efforts in this crisis, what I can tell you is that as the health secretary, I will be making sure that we fight to have that fair reward. But I think it’s worth noting the increases that have been put through in the last couple of years, and it is worth all of us coming together to show the value with which we hold nurses and everybody else who works across health and social care. Thank you for your question, Anna. Next question is from Allison Holt of the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Allison Holt: (22:03);Secretary of State, today’s official figures show the very high number of deaths in care homes, and also in hospitals of care home residents. The measures you’ve introduced today, aren’t they too little too late?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (22:18);Well, what I set out today are the things that we’ve been doing throughout this crisis to support people in care homes. And in the last couple of weeks, we have, as you say, added further measures. I’ve set them all out today. They’ve in fact, been put in place over the period of the crisis. And making sure that we give that support that’s needed, the extra money building on the money that we put in right at the start, the infection control processes, building on the infection control processes that we put in right at the start and have built throughout. It’s all part of doing everything we can to support people in care homes. And the good news is that the number of cases, the number of new cases is coming right down, but there is clearly a long way to go. And I’m also going to ask Nikki to comment on this strengthening of the link between the NHS and in particular, GPs and care homes, to make sure that we get that clinical support in every care home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (23:26);Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Matt. Look, it’s a GP. I know that it’s really important to offer care to all of our residents, whether you’re in a care home or you live at home, you live in a big house, small house, whatever it is, that’s what your GP practice is there to do. And around the country, the vast majority of practices look after their care homes in a way that you’d want your family member to be looked after. As a GP, if I talk a little bit about what happens in practice. So often, GP practices, or working with other GP practices come together to build what’s called a multidisciplinary team. So members from the practice, members from pharmacy, our allied health professionals, social care colleagues, community services colleagues, come together to offer support into care homes. And it’s really important that we recognize that it’s a multidisciplinary team that actually is needed to make sure that our care home residents stay safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (24:22);Importantly though, we’ve really ramped up that support over the last few weeks and months to make sure care home residents get the care that they need. Making sure that our care home managers are able to have a regular check in, whether that is with the GP or the lead professional in the team. And that might be an advanced nurse practitioner, it might be a geriatrician. It has to be the right person for the job. And we’ve got some incredible examples in Dorset and Frimley where this is happening really, really well. We’re doing a range of other measures to sure that care and residents are well supported. So that is a working with our clinical commissioning groups to make sure that medications provision is really optimized into care homes. And we have a suite of digital innovations there to back our care homes as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (25:07);So you’ve mentioned a few of them, Secretary of States, but making sure that care homes have NHS, good internet access, the digital tablets are absolutely revolutionary because it means that we can keep our residents and staff safe while we look after our care home residents through remote monitoring, and we can use those portals for residents to connect with their family and their loved ones as well. I think it’s really worth mentioning as well that we’ve asked every part of the country to offer infection prevention control trading to care homes. So that’s how to use PPE, how to don and doff safely, how to manage social distancing in what can be quite busy areas. And we’ve got 100% coverage around the country of these super trainers who are going out to look after our care homes. So it will take the whole system to look after our care home residents, but absolutely something the NHS has committed to doing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (26:00);Thanks very much. Sam Coats from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Allison Holt: (26:02);Can I just do a followup, please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (26:03);Sure, yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Allison Holt: (26:06);Yeah, if I may. If the R number has increased, are you rethinking the easing of the lockdown?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (26:14);Well, we’re constantly keeping the R under review, and it is one of our five tests, is for R to be below one. The latest evidence that Dr. Harries has presented, is that the R is between 0.7 and one. So we don’t think that it’s above one, we think that it is in a range of between 0.7 and one. So that still meets that test. But of course, we’re constantly looking at and updating all of the information that we see. Sam Coates from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Sam Coates: (26:55);Secretaries, thank you. Given our lives are determined by the R rate, why do you collectively appear quite relaxed that the R rate is up today? And the latest R rate suggests that transmission of the disease might not be reducing in the wider community, because your range includes one, flat. Is it because despite its presentation by the prime minister, it’s actually not the best measure to use for making decisions for the whole country? Because it’s skewed by hospitals and care homes and the tragic situations there. Or should we reconsider England’s lifting lockdown timetable, and does it help that the data is two or three weeks out of date?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (27:33);Well, those are really, really good questions, Sam. And if I’ll answer a couple, and then hand over to Dr. Harries. The first thing I’ll tell you on is on the timing. This is based on data from a couple of weeks ago, because of the way that it’s measured, but also from the survey data that the ONS have published. And as that survey grows, the measure of R will become more timely, but even in countries that have had large scale survey testing for some time, like Germany, there is still something of a lag. It is an incredibly important figure for policymakers, but it’s one data point to look at, alongside also the level of new cases, as well as the R, which is the rate at which they’re changing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (28:27);But I think a change in the range of R, that still encompasses most of the values that we think R could be, is very important to look at. But overall, this report from the scientists says that the R is not likely to be above one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (28:50);Sure. So, reinforcing those comments really, I mean, R is a very standard way of looking and comparing what’s happening, and it’s a really important measure. But the real outcome that we’re looking for is a reduction in number of cases, and getting rid of the epidemic in the UK. So that is our focus, not R, R is a representation of what is happening in that fight. So it is very important, but I think picking up some of the statistics around this, the R that you see presented has confidence intervals around it, how confident we are in it. As the Secretary of State has said, as we go forward, the ONS survey will give us key points of infection across the country, which will become increasingly important. The more points we have, the narrower our confidence concerns are, and the clearer we are that we know exactly how many cases there are in the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (29:45);So it’s not just the R value, it’s the triangulation of all of the evidence that we have. And I think the final point about the R value is, when it’s created it’s really important that different models and different estimates are put together. And so you will find published on the web now, slightly different variations. And that’s really important, because it challenges. If there are different outputs from different models, it’s an opportunity for us to look and say why is it different, either across the country, in a locality, or because the makeup of the model, the data streams which are going in, are slightly different. So it’s an important measure, but it definitely isn’t the only one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (30:29);Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Sam Coates: (30:31);Some acknowledgement, that it does look strange, that on the day that the R rate is published and is going up, you’re about to heading to a weekend where in England, at least, lots of people are going to go out on long journeys and enjoy the countryside. Are you absolutely confident that that’s the right decision?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (30:49);Well, we set out the five tests in advance. And one of the tests is that R isn’t above one. And in fact, so the data that has been published actually confirms that test rather than the opposite. But everybody can play their part in keeping R below one, and pushing R down. And you can do that by following the social distancing rules. So if you do go outdoors, do it only with members of your household, and keep two meters away from others who aren’t in your household. And those social distancing rules are incredibly clear, and they will help to keep us safe. Ayshah Tull from Channel Four."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Ayshah Tull: (31:38);Thank you, Secretary of State. There have been concerns raised to us about care homes that can’t apply for these tests on the portal. They say that it only applies to people with dementia and over 65’s. But that leaves out a very vulnerable group of people under 65 with multiple health conditions and problems, and also those with learning disabilities. Why have these people been left out?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (32:02);Well, those who are in care homes for working age people, as opposed to the elderly care homes, of course also need support, and often also are clinically vulnerable. It is true that age is the biggest factor in terms of your risk towards Coronavirus, but absolutely we need to make sure that care homes for people of working age also have access to tests. And we’re rolling that out too."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (32:36);If I could add to that. Shall I answer first? And I can see you’re trying to offer another question. I was just going to add to that, because I think as the Secretary of State has said, prioritization at the start was clearly we need to manage risk, that’s how we approach clinical risk. And different elements of risk were there, so care homes in particular, very, very stark variation in risk for the elderly, particularly 70, 80, 90. So it’s really quite stark in comparison to all of the variables."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (33:11);But in relation, I actually had an email yesterday from somebody with a unit in Nottinghamshire, trying to implement some very careful, really good work with his residents and staff. And I’ve actually put them in touch with the Director of Public Health. Now, I wouldn’t suggest everybody does that immediately, but the point I wanted to raise is, if there are concerns about particular practices or prioritization that’s needed, there are local oversight of that. And directors of public health are working with the local NHS, and local authority Director of Adult Social Care, to make sure that where there are priorities, that particularly if there is an outbreak or something like that in a non elderly care home, that they can access tests."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (34:01);You had a follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Ayshah Tull: (34:03);I did have a follow up. I just wondered, a lot of people that I’ve spoken to say that they feel like they’ve been forgotten. And I wonder, do you think that you’re putting the people with learning disabilities at the back of the queue?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (34:13);No. I don’t think that’s the case, because we’ve been throughout this, ensuring that the guidance that goes out is to all care homes, of course. And one of the things that I’ve been very worried about as Secretary of State throughout my time in this job, is to ensure that we get the support to people in care homes, for those of working age as well as elderly care homes. It is so important that we do that, and we have done that through this crisis too, but we’ve got to make sure also that we follow the clinical advice in terms of the different risks that people face. And so if there is an individual care home that thinks they’re not getting what is clinically needed, then of course they should get in contact, and they should, starting with the local Director of Public Health, but ultimately they should raise that. But we’ve got to follow the clinical advice in terms of how we apply the testing capability that we have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (35:22);And just to add onto that, there’s some very good resources in terms of specific advice and guidance written for learning disabled as well. So I think it’s not just about carers and parents and guardians or care managers, it’s very much for individuals themselves."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (35:39);Thank you, Ayshah. Michael Smith from the Daily Mirror."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Michael Smith: (35:46);Good afternoon. I’ve got two quick questions, firstly to the scientists: With the government hoping to start reopening schools in the next couple of weeks, you’ve no doubt carried out some quite complex modeling of the risks of taking that action. Could you give me an idea of what the government considers to be an acceptable level of risk to teachers and parents, in terms of increased infections and potentially deaths?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Michael Smith: (36:15);And also to the Secretary of State, for years, schools have been telling the Daily Mirror that they struggle to afford basic equipment, like pens and pencils for children to use in the classroom. Social distancing is going to be hard work in schools. It’s hard to get kids to wash their hands in the best of times. And before the lockdown, teachers were telling us they didn’t have enough soap and hand sanitizer to go around. If a teacher looks at all, this looks at their own school and decides the risk to their staff and to their community is too great to reopen their school, what consequences would they face?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (36:58);Well, on the second point, and then if I ask Nikki and Jenny to comment on the first question. We think it’s really important that this is a team effort. It is an incredible challenge that we face with the reopening of schools. I think everybody understands that trying to get schools open in a way that is safe, and only in a way that is safe, that is really important for children’s education. But we’ve got to do it in a way that that keeps the control of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Matt Hancock: (37:32);Now, the good news is, in the same way that it’s terrible news that this virus impacts on the elderly so much, the good news is that it seems to spare children in almost every case. Not quite every case, but almost every case. And so the risk to children is much, much lower than to anybody else in society, to any other age group. Unless, certainly if you don’t have underlying health conditions. And that means that we are able to propose going down this route of reopening schools. I wouldn’t support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so, and it is safe to do so. And as you say, Mike, there’s an awful lot of work to do in each individual school, to make sure that that is done in a way that’s safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Dr. Kanani: (38:35);Thank you. So, I’m a mom of two school aged children, and can I just thank the teaching staff actually, for responding so quickly in such an unusual situation. It’s not something that they would have ever had to deal with before, and they’ve been really quite phenomenal. But risk is relative, isn’t it? And we have to think about the wider risks to children and families as well. So as you said, we wouldn’t send children back if it wasn’t safe to do so. But we’re doing that in a careful, phased way, and monitoring the whole time-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (39:03);… o make sure that children and families are well. But actually, some of our children who are more vulnerable, who need more support, need to be back in school to get the benefit of both the social environments, but also the physical space as well. So it’s really important that we carefully get our children back to school because actually, that is what’s going to be good for them in the long run."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (39:24);Thank you. [crosstalk 00:39:24]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (39:24);Should I add to that? So I think, just sort of trying to put the risk in perspective, if currently we have say two or three in a thousand of our population with infection, in the proposed timeframe coming forward in the next couple of weeks, that’s likely to halve. So I think there’s a lot of anxiety, I think, around this, but people need to think through, in an average, I don’t know, infant school with a hundred children, the likelihood of anybody having this disease is very small and diminishing with time. So I think we just need to keep that in perspective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (39:57);The other thing is, picking up Nikki’s point, on a public health perspective, there are all sorts of risks. And children who have been invited back to school are at key points of their education, and their longer term health risks of not getting good basic education, which then takes them into work employment in adult life, and gives them the prevention opportunity from longterm conditions is really very important."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (40:21);But I think the concerns that you’re particularly referring to are around teachers and children in enclosed environments, if you like. And there is very good advice has come out from Public Health England, lots of input from pediatricians, as well, in a hierarchy of controls to manage that risk. It’s not simply about a bit of kit. It’s actually about how you manage groups. So in many ways, managing them more as if you were a family, where you wouldn’t think about putting on PPE or handling it different ways, but you keep in those groups, you can distance within the school. And in fact, school environments for the reasons which Nikki has said, which are teachers are brilliant. I know, as a parent, they’re often much more productive than I was at trying to get my children to wash their hands consistently and practice good hygiene. So there’s some really strong guidance out there to try and support this. And the background risk of disease is diminishing all the time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (41:21);Thank you, Andy McCaskill from Writers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Andy McCaskill: (41:23);Good. This is a question from the Secretary of State. The prime minister said in Parliament this week that the government ordered a lock down of care homes before the national lockdown on March the 23rd. But the guidance to care homes before then was issued on March the 13th, which suggested a restriction only on people infected with COVID and those feeling sick. And your own department told us that the only directive on a ban on care homes came on April the 2nd. That’s 10 days after the national lockdown. So based on the words of your own department, do you think the prime minister should correct what you said in Parliament?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (42:03);No. On the 13th of March, we did introduce this extra guidance. And on the basis of that guidance, many of the care home providers, for instance, KUK, at that point stopped visitors. Now the challenge with much of the management of care homes from a national level is that their accountabilities are local, and it is a first and foremost responsibility of local government. So we did bring in that guidance on the 13th. As a result of that, many care homes did stop visitors. As I said in my opening remarks, we strengthened that guidance all along. And the point that I think I tried to articulate in my opening comments, is that we’ve tried to build infection control and the support and the protective ring around care homes, right from the start."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (43:05);And Alison Morris, from the Irish News."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Andy McCaskill: (43:09);Just something on the point of transparency, a lot of relatives have told us that a lot of care homes are resisting telling them the number of infections or even the number of deaths from coronavirus in care homes. I’m just wondering whether that information should be made public to the families and the general public."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (43:29);Yes. I didn’t know about that. And it’s certainly something that I’d like to look into. And because our overall approach in this is that transparency is the best way forward. We’ve asked the CQC and now the ONS to come in and do more, to be transparent about the impact of coronavirus. Unlike many countries, we put deaths of people, whether they die in a care home or in the wider community or in hospital, into our overall figures. We’ve taken an approach of maximum transparency. And so I can understand why people have been in contact with you about that. And it’s certainly something that we will take away."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (44:13);Jenny?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (44:14);I was just going to add, I think we just need to think really carefully about what a care home is. Because as we’ve heard earlier in this, it might be a learning disabled care home. They’re not all big care homes. Some of them are really quite small, and we need to be careful about individual clinical information and families as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (44:32);And I was just going to support this. So there’s an ONS survey, which you may well have seen, out today. There are reports coming through from CQC. So there is a lot of work, trying to make the deaths information much more understandable, I think, because it’s clearly quite difficult, with individuals who have multiple diseases, for example. When a death is registered, it’s not always easy to pinpoint, as a doctor actually, what the overriding cause of death is. I think it’s quite likely that there are more deaths associated with COVID-19 in older people because we know that the risk, the age is a very, very significant risk. But they will have many other illnesses, as well. So it doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what they have died from. It’s quite right, that there is interest in this, and there is additional work currently ongoing, to look to see how older people and individuals from care homes have been using hospital services, for example, along with how the rest of the population have. Some of that usage has dropped, and it’s important we understand that that was appropriate in those individuals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (45:45);Thanks. Andy, is that… I didn’t realize you wanted to come in again. I hope that’s answered your question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Andy McCaskill: (45:48);Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (45:51);Okay. Thanks very much, indeed. So finally, we’ll go to Alison Morris from the Irish News. Alison."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Alison Morris: (45:58);Aye, Secretary of State, as you will be aware, businesses impacted by the lockdown measures are expecting a very slow recovery. This week, members of the devolved executive were braced by government. The [inaudible 00:46:09] border posts will be required within Northern Ireland for goods destined for the EU market, after the prime minister previously insisted that no such checks would be necessary. What do government intend to put in place to mitigate this double pressure on businesses in Northern Ireland, to have both the COVID lockdown measures and pending [inaudible 00:46:27] border checks to contend with? And can I also ask the deputy chief medical officer, given that the devolved regions are now leading up, dying at a different pace, and with varying R rates, will she be advising COVID risk assessments, temperature checks, and advice to self isolate, et cetera, at ports in our ports for those traveling either in or out of Northern Ireland to other parts of the UK?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (46:51);Well, thank you very much indeed. On the first subject, I know that the prime minister spoke to the [inaudible 00:46:58] this afternoon, a very positive discussion, and we fully intend to meet all the commitments that we’ve made, in terms of delivering on the result of the referendum. Jenny, do you want to answer the-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (47:14);Yes, well, clearly it will be for Secretary of State and political colleagues to decide on the policy at borders. But I think from a scientific perspective, as a scientist, as UK CMO teams, we work very closely in understanding the science. And there may well be times, whether it be within England or across the UK countries, where potentially, differential policies will apply as we look in more detail and get more granular insight, as we dampen down the epidemic right across the UK. So I think that is all entirely appropriate. I don’t think, actually, although you’re hearing site differences in timing or announcement, actually the science that’s underlying it, I’m sure the public can see coming through just the same. So things like the risk of being outside is minimal in managing that potential change in an R value, for example."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (48:08);And I think nearly all the UK countries are recognizing that there are slightly different epidemic curves as we showed in the slides earlier. So I think those conversations will keep going, the science and depending it is the same. And we do need to respond to our different populations, taking account of all of the things like density of population and travel patterns, as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Jenny Harries: (48:30);On temperature, I’ve spoken about this before. The evidence around temperature checks, whether it be on borders, or whether it be going into work, and particularly for COVID, is not a very valid intervention in terms of scientific prevention. If you have an incubation period up to 14 days, the chances of you finding somebody with that temperature on the minute that they walk through a border or the doorway to work is very small. And in fact, we know that quite a large proportion of people who have symptoms for COVID actually do not have a temperature, at least in the early symptomatic phase. So much more important, I think, that we focus on people taking themselves out of their work and social environments, as soon as they feel that they have any symptoms at all."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-15-with-matt-hancock","Speaker 4: (49:14);Fantastic. Thank you very much, indeed. And that ends today’s coronavirus daily briefing."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (00:04);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street Press Conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, our Deputy Chief Medical Officer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (00:13);I’ll start with the daily update on the latest data on coronavirus. 2,682,716 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, and that includes 100,678 tests carried out yesterday. 246,406 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 2684 cases since yesterday. 9408 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, which is down 13% from this time last week. And I’m very sad to report that of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 across all settings, 34,796 have now died. That’s an increase of 160 deaths on yesterday. It goes without saying, we offer our condolences to the friends and family of every individual who’s passed away during this coronavirus pandemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (01:15);This is a challenging time, and as we chart the right course over the weeks and months ahead, our overriding priority remains to save lives, whilst also at the same time, preserving livelihoods and allowing people to return, over time, and as and when it’s safe, to something resembling more normal way of living. So on the 11th of May, we set out a roadmap to provide the information, the advice, and the reassurance, to businesses, to public services, to other organizations, and to employees and citizens up and down the country. I want to thank everyone who is making the adjustments and engaging with us in government to forge a path ahead in a sure-footed and sustainable way. Now of course, we recognize that people have concerns, they have questions, and we want to work together with them and with everyone involved to provide the necessary confidence and reassurance in the next steps that we’re poised to make. That approach is summarized in the slides, which if we could now have them up on the screen, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (02:20);And you’ll see from slide one, as people will be aware, we’ve established a new COVID Alert System with five levels, each relating to the current level of threat posed by the virus. The alert level is focused on the rate of infection known as the R-value, as well as the total number of coronavirus cases overall. That alert level helps us to determine the social-distancing measures that we need to fight the virus. So the lower the level, the fewer, or the less restrictive, the measures that we will need at any given time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (02:54);Since the lockdown began at the end of March, we’ve been at Level Four, as on the slide. And thanks to the hard work and the huge sacrifices across the UK, and the progress that we’ve made as a result of that, particularly in relation to compliance with the social-distancing measures, we’re in the process of moving from Level Four to Level Three on the slide. We will do that through a number of very careful and deliberate steps."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (03:22);Slide two, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (03:25);So you’ll see that last week, the prime minister set out the first of three steps designed to carefully modify the measures that had been put in place. And by gradually easing certain measures, we can begin to allow people to return to something resembling a more normal way of life. The choices we make, what we’re asking the public to do, and what we’re asking them not to do, are designed to avoid the very real risk of a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS, and of course, risk turning a temporary economic painful moment for the country into permanent damage to the UK economy. At every step, we will closely monitor the impact of easing restrictions, and in particular, the impact on the spread of the virus. It’s only by collecting and monitoring the data that we will be able to take the next step, which is indicated as step two on the slides, and that will be no earlier than June 1st. Now, I understand it’s natural for people to question why they can’t do one or the other thing now, why certain distinctions have be made, but in reality, you have to look at the package of measures as a whole, mindful of the risk of the R-level, and taking into account the various different economic and social effects combined. So we’ve adopted a balanced approach guided at all times by the science, and as I said, the overriding need to avoid a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (04:52);Of course, it’s true to say that making any changes inherently comes with some risk of spreading the virus, compared to simply staying at home. But it’s also true that staying in permanent lockdown is itself not sustainable on health grounds or economic grounds. That’s why we’ve only used measures where it can be done with the lowest risk possible. And that’s also why we are watching the impact of every change that we make very closely. I know the last couple of months have been really tough for families, for businesses, for everyone up and down the UK, but it’s only by keeping to the plan, sticking to the rules, even including when those rules change, that we’ll beat coronavirus for good."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (05:36);Slide three, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (05:39);That’s why we’ve asked people to stay alert, to control the virus, to save lives, as we make changes to the measures in place in England, and adjust the government’s advice accordingly. Now, for the vast majority of people, that still means staying at home as much as possible, but those that can’t work from home, they should return to work with the arrangements in place to ensure that it can be safely and responsibly done. We’ve also adjusted, as you can see from the slides, the advice to allow people to exercise more, to visit public outdoor spaces, but staying two meters apart from those outside their own household."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (06:19);And as ever, people need to keep washing their hands regularly and carrying out the hygiene measures that we’ve advertised before. Our advice is to wear a face covering when you’re outside the home, in enclosed spaces and where it’s difficult to socially distance. For example, if going to the shops or traveling on public transport. If you or anyone in your household develop symptoms, then you still all need to self-isolate. Now, while we’re asking the public to do these things, we in government will keep ramping up the effort that we need to see to get the UK back to a more normal way of living."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (06:56);And with that in mind, today the health secretary announced that anyone in the UK with COVID-19 symptoms can now get a test by booking online. I can also report that we’ve recruited now over 21,000 contact tracers and call-handlers in England with the implementation of our test and trace program. That program is absolutely key in the next steps that we need to take as a country to come through this pandemic safely and responsibly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (07:24);Jonathan, if you’d like to run us through the latest data?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (07:27);Thank you, Secretary of State. Good afternoon, everybody. I’ve just got a few data slides to show you in the normal fashion, beginning with this one, which shows you Apple Maps searches for directions. So it is confined to Apple users, and it shows the beginning of the period of lockdown on the left, on the 23rd of March, and what has happened to searches for walking instructions, driving instructions and public transport from that point until the very recent past. You can see that there has been a gradual, but only gradual, upward trend in searches related to walking and driving. But for public transport, this trend is essentially flat. This is very much in line with the guidance that the government has issued about avoiding public transport wherever possible, saving it for key workers. And clearly, this is a trend that the public are following."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (08:32);I’ve shown you the two data points on the right of the slide before, now. That’s compared with last year, 44% of adults are working at home in the period 24th of April to the 3rd of May, compared with 12% at the same time last year. And that 80% of adults report they have either left the home for permitted reasons or not at all in that period."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (08:59);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (09:03);Moving on now to testing. These data are correct as at 0900 hours this morning, and they relate to tests processed and sent out. The broad message is that we are continuing to test at the rate of around 100,000 tests per day, and that in total, almost 2.7 million tests have been used since the crisis began. In terms of confirmed cases, the data as of this morning, were overnight for 2684 new cases, out of a grand total of diagnosed cases of just under a quarter of a million. But what you can see, if you look to the bottom right hand corner of the slide, the green bars, you can now see a definite and sustained decline in new confirmed cases, which continues to be encouraging."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:06);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:10);So these are data I showed to you last week, updated of course, data from hospitals. The top curve relates to estimated admissions with COVID-19 in England. 678 is the latest figure, down from 701 on the 9th of May. So again, steady declines, and you can see that in the top blue curve. Turning at the bottom of the slide to the percentage of critical care beds currently occupied by COVID-19 patients, this trend is also consistently down across the four nations, and currently the figure runs at 19%."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:55);Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:59);And then this slide also relates to hospitals. It relates to all of the UK, and it relates to the total number of people in hospital with COVID-19 over time, updated as of the 17th of May. What you can see here is that everywhere the numbers of patients in hospital with COVID-19 is now in sustained decline. Again, very good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (11:27);And the final slide, please. This is the daily deaths data. These are deaths confirmed with a positive test in the UK. As of the 18th of May, we are reporting 160 deaths and a total of 34,796 with a positive test. What you can see, and again, it remains the most important thing to look for, is the overall longterm trend, as illustrated by the orange line-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (12:03);… which is showing a consistent and solid decline as the days and weeks roll by. Thank you, Secretary of State."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (12:12);Jonathan, thanks very much. We’ll open it up to questions. And I think there’s one from David from Barry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","David: (12:20);Good afternoon. As we take the first tentative steps towards releasing the lockdown, when will the government outline the roadmap ahead beyond the pandemic to ensure a swift fiscal health and wellbeing recovery? And what has already been discussed and decided?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (12:42);Well, thank you very much. It’s Danny from Barry. I’m terribly sorry. I had David here. Danny, we’ve already published over 50 page roadmap to how we rebuild after coronavirus. And that includes the three steps that I set out on the slides. The key thing, and there are different measures at different stages relating to no earlier than the 1st of June, the phasing of reopening of primary schools, different issues for businesses at different times. So non-essential retail will be dealt with at that point. But whether it’s the 1st of June or the 4th of July or any subsequent steps, we will only take those decisions and take those measures based on the scientific advice that tells us we can responsibly do so. And I think the worst of all worlds will be to trip up now and to stumble when we’ve made the progress that the Deputy Chief Medical Officer has set out very clearly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (13:39);So we’ll be guided. We set a roadmap, but it’s a conditional roadmap. And we will monitor very carefully based on the changes that we’ve made over the last week and see what impact that has. And we will assess where the R rate is and the other coronavirus data is before taking any subsequent steps no earlier than the 1st of June. Jonathan, would you add anything to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (13:59);No."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (14:01);Danny, thanks very much. I think there’s one from James from Wittering. James asked by text, is the government preparing for a second wave on PPE, ventilators, testing, et cetera, so all the issues of the first wave won’t happen again? I’ll let the Deputy Chief Medical Officer comment, but one of the key things we’ve said all along is first of all, that we’re going to be very mindful to avoid a second wave. We want to keep the R level down, the rate of transmission down to avoid that. And we do not want and we will not sanction measures where we fear, well, there’s a risk that they would take us above R1."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (14:43);At the same time, when we set out our five tests for easing the lockdown, and they still in large part apply, one of the key things that we wouldn’t take measures until we’re absolutely confident that we got all of the capacity we need in the NHS. One of the things that we’ve done and it has been effective is we’ve made sure that at every step, the NHS has not been overwhelmed. And in particular, the critical care capacity that Jonathan showed on the slides has not been overwhelmed. And it’s not just good enough to do that day by day. We want to make sure that with any steps we take in the future, that that remains the case. Jonathan, what would you add to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (15:22);Thank you, Secretary of State. So I would add that we’re absolutely hoping not to have a second wave. And that is one of the reasons why we are being so careful about unlocking social distancing one piece at a time, because we absolutely don’t want this to get out of control again. However, is it right and proper to prepare for emergencies? Is it right and proper to put ourselves in a good position to be able to deal with an upsurge of cases? Absolutely. And let me emphasize a couple of things here. One is that maybe people are just hoping and praying that this virus will just go away as indeed I hope and pray it will. But the reality is that certainly until we get a vaccine and only if we get a vaccine that is really capable of suppressing disease levels will we ever be what we would call kind of out of this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:27);And so from that perspective, we may have to live and learn to live with this virus in the long term. And certainly for many months to come, if not several years. A vaccine may change that, but we can’t be sure we will get a vaccine. The other thing to say is that this virus is a new virus. We don’t fully understand it. We don’t understand something called seasonality. And one of the things that’s very clear, for example, with flu viruses, is that they come in our cold winters and the levels of transmission and circulation decline over the summer months. Now, the data we have on other coronaviruses, we’ve looked at very carefully, and it is not clear that these coronaviruses are as seasonal as influenza, but there may be an element of seasonality and it may well be that the autumn and winter conditions provide a better environment for the virus to then do its work again. So we have to be very cautious about that and plan for these kind of healthcare surges that we hope we don’t need, but we want to be ready for them if they happen. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (17:45);Very good. And thank you, James, for your question. We’ll open it up to the media now, and I think we’ve got Fergus Walsh first from the BBC. Fergus, over to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Fergus Walsh: (17:53);Thank you. You’ve just added loss of taste and smell as a key symptom for coronavirus. France advised people back in March that if they lost taste or smell that they should self isolate. Hasn’t the UK been very slow to act?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (18:11);Jonathan, I think that’s probably one for you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (18:13);Yes, thank you, Fergus. We’ve been very careful about looking at the data on anosmia and looking to see if adding it to the case definition would change something in terms of what we could practically do. Now I do understand, and you’re absolutely right, that anosmia has been recognized for some time now as a possible symptom of COVID-19. But if you unpick that a bit further, one of the first questions is how often does anosmia come really early in the illness? That’s the first question. Versus coming later on in the illness, when there are many other symptoms that are evident, particularly cough and fever, which are absolutely the most prominent."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (19:11);The next point is how often does anosmia occur on its own in the absence of other symptoms? And the answer seems to be very rarely indeed. And so from that perspective, what we’ve had to do is go through all of the possible symptoms of COVID-19. And other than fever and cough, the WHO list includes tiredness, aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, skin rash, even loss of speech or movement is something that the WHO put on there. So what we have had to do is do some very careful analysis behind the scenes to try and work out when looking at the whole range of symptoms again, which of those it might be useful or important to add in terms of picking patients up and improving the very simple and easy to remember symptom cluster we had already of cough and fever."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (20:22);And that’s why we have taken our time in this country because we wanted to do that, again, painstaking and very careful analysis before we jumped to any conclusions. And even if it was [inaudible 00:20:34] obvious that anosmia was part of this, we wanted to be sure that adding it to cough and fever, as opposed to just listing it, adding it in formerly into our definition, was the right thing to do. And based on advice from NERVTAG, we have made that decision."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (20:54);Fergus, did you want to come back on anything?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Fergus Walsh: (20:58);Professor Tim Spector estimates that between 100,000 and 200,000 cases of COVID-19 may be missed by the failure to include this earlier. How many cases of COVID-19 do you think have been missed as a result of not including this earlier on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (21:17);I don’t have those figures to my fingertips. I’m not sure anyone’s, other than Professor Spector, is trying to make those kind of estimates. What I can tell you is that from the Public Health England data set called the FF100, the first few hundred cases, there are actually 229 cases in there, all laboratory confirmed COVID, all of whom have been studied in considerable detail and 0.44% reported anosmia on its own as a symptom. So the point about anosmia is that it doesn’t always come as the first symptom. And even if it does, it is followed by the cough, the fever, and many of the other symptoms that I’ve talked about referring to the WHO definition. So you don’t miss those cases. And the important thing was to work out if this would add any sensitivity to the diagnostic cluster we were using. And the answer is it makes a small, very small difference, and we have therefore decided to do it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (22:29);Thanks, Fergus. Next up, Beth Rigby from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Beth Rigby: (22:33);Thank you. First, Secretary of State, you’re asking people to use their common sense as we come out of lockdown. And you’re also asking many people to go back to work or soon send their children back to school. But isn’t it common sense for people to wait until you have that track and trace program properly in place before they go back to work or before they send their kids to school? Otherwise, aren’t you asking people to make something of a leap of faith? And Professor Van-Tam, the R rate last week was said to be 0.7 to one. Parents and teachers are obviously anxious about transmission in primary schools. Do you expect there to be some level of COVID-19 transmission in schools once children return? And how do you expect that to impact the R number?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (23:24);Thanks, Beth. Well, first of all, we’re making good progress with the test, track, and tracing regime. As the health sector has announced today, we’ve got 21,000 traces. The level of testing is above 100,000. We’ve got 60,000 downloads of the app on the Isle of Wight pilot. So we’re making good progress on that. In terms of the measures we’ve taken right at this stage, as you will know, at step one, we’ve been pretty cautious. And that is precisely because we want to make sure footed and sustainable steps."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (24:03);When we come to the later steps and as and when the testing capacity and the tracing capacity is up and running, we’ll be able to. It’ll give us more room for maneuver, more flexibility. We are making very sure that we’re taking the right steps at the right moment. Obviously, the testing and the tracing is going to be a key component, particularly medium to longer term as we come through the coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (24:24);Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (24:25);Yes. Thank you, Beth. I’m going to chop your question into four bits and answers in bits, if that’s all right?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (24:34);The first point is about disease in children. We are absolutely aware of a small number of cases in children associated with a disease that looks a bit like Kawasaki Syndrome, looks a bit like toxic shock syndrome, but these are very, very, very small numbers compared with the vast majority of confirmed infections in children, which are really extremely mild compared to the illness suffered by adults. We do think, to conclude, we think children experience mild disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (25:11);The next question is, do children have a higher infection rate or a lower infection rate than adults? You can gain those data from serology studies, studies of the blood to look for antibodies. The emerging data from around the world, on the whole, suggests that the rate of infection in children is about the same as in adults, possibly a little lower in the younger aged children, but they get this much more mild disease on the whole."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (25:47);The next question then is, can children transmit the virus to adults? Here we have to acknowledge that we’re working with a new virus where the data are pretty sparse at the moment. But the experts have already had a look at this and formed a conclusion that unlike influenza, like flu, where we are very clear that children drive transmission in the community to adults, it really does not seem to be the same kind of signal with COVID-19, that children are not these kind of big, high-output transmitters as they are with flu."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (26:29);Then to your final point about getting children back to school and is that safe in terms of the R naught, all of the measures that are being considered always are run against the test case of can we keep control of R naught? If the answer is yes, then it will be considered. If the answer is it’s going to risk pushing the R naught higher than one, then our science advice to ministers will always be no. We advise against it. As simple as that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:08);Of course, this is a difficult balancing act, you’re absolutely right, because there are significant welfare and wellbeing issues for children who are out of school for months and months on end. It’s delicate and difficult and I accept that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (27:25);Beth, do you want to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Beth Rigby: (27:26);Just quickly. You’ve done a great job in recruiting people to track and trace, but in terms of the app, just to be fixed parents out there, will the app be ready by June the 1st, when you ask some of us to send their kids back to school? Because parents might want that reassurance."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (27:46);Again, all of these steps are a balanced assessment, not just of one or other element, but particularly the R level and the prevalence of coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (27:55);In terms of the app, it’s still our attention to roll it out across the country for everyone to use in the weeks ahead. I can’t be any more precise at this stage. But as I said before, we’re making pretty good progress with it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (28:08);Beth, thanks very much. I’ll go to Gary Gibbon next, Channel Four."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Gary Gibbon: (28:12);Thank you very much. It sounds a bit as though the progress on the app has slipped a bit. We were told to expect it to be rolled out in the middle of May. You’re saying you can’t say any more than that it’ll be in the weeks ahead. Given that the app and the testing are two key ingredients to giving people reassurance about going back to work and going to school and the rest of it, are you’re worried by that and also by the fact that some of these tests seem to be coming back really rather late, like sometimes five days or something like that, you’ve missed the opportunity potentially to quarantine someone, haven’t you?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (28:46);Well, look, we’re learning as is perfectly reasonable to point out. We’re learning all the way as we go through this pandemic and not just on the scientific side but on the innovation that we need to get a grip on it and control the virus. We are making good progress on the testing and on the tracing and on the pilot in the Isle of Wight, in relation to the app. We’re going to make sure, and we’ve always said, of course, that the steps that we might take at what is step two on the slides that I just showed, will only be taken at the earliest on the 1st of June. We’ve not committed ourselves to anything at this point in time. What we’re doing is giving a roadmap with maximum conditionality to make sure both in terms of the measures that we’ve taken at step one and any subsequent measures, we’re confident that we can take further sure-footed steps."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (29:37);Feel free. Come back."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Gary Gibbon: (29:39);May I quickly?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (29:42);Please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Gary Gibbon: (29:43);Could you guide us, maybe the professor can, to what extent was the modeling on which the easing is based, based on a fully-functioning app and the testing process that was bringing back results before 48 hours?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (29:56);[crosstalk 00:29:58]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (29:57);[crosstalk 00:00:29:58]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (29:59);Yes. I want to be clear that the app is one part of the test and trace system. The rest of it is much more of the tried and tested methodology used by Public Health England for this, and for many other diseases. The mainstay will always be the Public Health England system, as evidenced by the 21,500 recruits, one third of whom are doctors or nurses to help with that. That’s the mainstay of it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (30:36);Testing is very much testing for action. We don’t do it for the hell of it. It informs action for people either to be reassured that they have a negative result and they don’t need to go into self-isolation, or that they absolutely must, and it will inform contact tracing as part of test and trace. It absolutely will."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:00);From that perspective, you are absolutely right that we need to do it bigger and faster, and as fast as we can. We are sending a clear message as scientists that it needs to be fast, and we have to work as hard as we can to improve the timeliness of the testing system as we go along."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (31:23);Thanks, Gary. Of course, the reality is the further along it is, the more expanded it is, the more flexibility we’ll have. It’s not a binary choice, but it’s proceeding at pace."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (31:33);Tom Newton Dunn from The Sun."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Tom Newton Dunn: (31:35);[inaudible 00:07:35], thank you very much. May I ask you about the authorization resolution taken today which Britain is a signatore too? It calls for a review into the international community’s response to the pandemic. It doesn’t mention anything about getting to the bottom of the origin of it. It doesn’t mention China by name at all. Are you letting China off the hook here, or do you, A, want an independent inquiry after like Australia does and, B, want this inquiry to get to the bottom of the origin of the pandemic?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Tom Newton Dunn: (32:05);A question from Mr. Van-Tam as well, please. Jonathan, in your incredibly honest way as usual, can you update us on how far Sage has got investigating the double-bubble, co-joining of two households? In particular for the over seventies, should they hold out any hope they’ll be able to co-join them with their children or grandchildren, or is that unrealistic at this stage? Perhaps now would be a good time to manage their expectations, because they’re running pretty high."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (32:34);Tom, thanks very much. Well, certainly at the international level, we’ve been very clear and we work with all of our partners, including Australia and many others because we want this review to come on the strongest support because it’s more likely to be effective if it does. It’s got to be. Obviously, it’s going to be international. It’s got to be credible, which means it’s independent and impartial, and it’s got to able to get to the bottom of how it happened, how the outbreak happened and spread and critically the lessons that we can learn for future pandemics."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (33:06);Jon?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:06);Yes. Thank you for the question. My mum lives on her own. She hasn’t seen her grandchildren for many months, so I appreciate how difficult and stressful this really is for the kind of categories of people that you mentioned out there. It is hurting and it is difficult. Sage is looking at this at the moment. The matter is under review. It would not be right and proper for me to comment further at this stage. Therefore, with respect, I won’t."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (33:45);Tom, do you want to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Tom Newton Dunn: (33:48);Just a quick follow-up for Mr. Van-Tam. I completely understand your reasoning there. Perhaps you could offer a bit more in regards to camping, which you did kindly offer to look into last week. If Brits can’t go on holiday anytime soon, maybe can they go camping outdoors not co-joining with anybody safely?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (34:05);Yes. I’ve had quite a lot of correspondence about that since my appearances last week, as you’d imagine. I stand ready to give advice to the government on all of those complex issues as and when it asks for it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (34:21);Right. Good. Thanks, Tom. Kate Proctor from The Guardian."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Kate Proctor: (34:25);Hi, thank you. For the foreign secretary, thousands of care workers from outside the European economic area are risking their lives working in Britain, in care homes in the coronavirus pandemic. These same carers are being asked to pay 625 pounds to use the NHS. In many cases, this is the same service in which they work for. Will the government exempt migrant care workers from this NHS charge or will they scrap it altogether?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Kate Proctor: (34:55);For Jonathan Van-Tam, I wanted to ask what you thought the scientific justification is for introducing a quarantine period now, as opposed to doing it earlier on in March or April, particularly considering the infection rates for other countries in Europe is particularly low?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (35:14);Thanks very much. Well, the there’s no current plans to make the change that you described. What we do want however, home secretary’s very keen to make sure we got a sensitive immigration system for all those exceptional frontline workers, whether it’s in care homes or in the NHS. We recognize that there are a lot of people who come from abroad that do those jobs and make a huge, invaluable, and valued contribution to this country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (35:39);Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:40);Yeah. On the question of quarantine, why didn’t we do it previously and we’re talking subject to ministerial announcements about maybe doing it now?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:55);Well, my recollection is we did do it before, that on the 29th of February and then I think on the 30th of February-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van Tam: (36:01);… we announced that travelers returning from the hotspot of Wuhan and then Hubei province respectively, when they arrived in the UK, must self isolate at home for 14 days. And then I believe, and you’ve caught me on the hop here, I’m afraid. I think it was about four weeks later, we had made further advice that people returning from Northern Italy, initially it was Lombardy province, then it became Northern Italy and South Korea and Iran I think, we asked them also on arrival in the UK to go home and quarantine, self isolate at home for 14 days. That being the potential maximum incubation period of this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van Tam: (36:53);So I think we have done it before. We did it for at a time when the virus activity was concentrated into international hotspots, such as Hubei province, South Korea, Northern Italy, we’re now in a very different world where this virus has spread completely internationally. And we are lucky in that we are driving down our case rate to the point where we are becoming an area of low incidence of COVID-19. And at that point, then it becomes more sensible to think about what the contribution of travelers from abroad might be. So that’s, I hope, knits it all together for you, but I haven’t got the precise dates on some of the previous quarantines, but we did it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (37:45);Okay. Would you like to follow up on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Kate Proctor: (37:48);Oh yeah. Thank you for that explanation, that was very helpful. But to the Foreign Secretary again, you said that you want to have a sympathetic immigration system. I don’t understand what’s sympathetic about a 625 pound NHS charge for carers and you have made it exempt for other health workers. So why not carers?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (38:06);Well, we keep these things constantly under review, but that’s a provision that applies to all workers, subject to the definitions coming into this country. We’re doing lots of other things to support the care sector, including the action plan for the sector that was launched a few weeks ago. And if your concern is having the people to work in the care sector, of course, we put extra money in an extra recruitment program to make sure we’re able to do that. So we’ll keep it under review and I understand the point, Kate, you’re making. And it’s absolutely right to pay tribute to the incredible work that so many do. And in fairness, it’s not just in the NHS, it’s in so many other ways, but we also do have a set of immigration controls in place and how they apply in the COVID pandemic is something we keep carefully under review."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (38:54);Thank you very much, Kate. And lastly, I think we’ve got Jez Hemming from the North Wales Daily Post and BBC Wales."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jez Hemming: (39:02);Good evening. What do you say to claims the decision to relax lockdown in England is undermining efforts to contain the virus in North Wales where a full lockdown remains, cases are increasing, but tourists are still heading over the border in large numbers. I’d be interested to know what Mr. Van Tam thinks about the divergence between the English and Welsh scientific approaches."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (39:25);Well Jez, to start with, we’ve actually done a pretty good job, all nations in the UK of adhering to the social distancing measures and getting the incidents and the R level down. That was one of the successful elements of the strategy. We’ve had, I have to say very good collaboration with the devolved administrations. I’ve sat in on COBRA meetings where the, notwithstanding the different either perspectives or slightly different considerations, which will apply in different nations of the UK, we’ve actually had a UK wide approach. Equally, we’ve recognized that given the devolved competencies and given the level of coronavirus in different parts of the UK, there may be different speeds at which the different nations proceed or even at regional level. And in answer to your question about people from England going to Wales. We’ve be very clear. Anyone that wants to travel say from England to Wales or any other part of the United Kingdom needs to be very mindful of the regulations that the relevant devolved administration will have in place. Jonathan, would you like to add anything?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van Tam: (40:28);Yes. So I’ll answer my bit of the question. So decisions that are made are always a complex blend of science, politics and practicality. And I think we have to recognize the right of different parts of the UK to make their own decisions. What I would be far more worried about is if there was a separate stream of science driving decisions in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland from England, but SAGE absolutely is a committee that advises the whole of the nation in that sense. One of the difficulties with all of these data and working out what’s happening is that as you chop the UK into smaller and smaller regions, you don’t have as much region specific data to work with and the granularity of the picture down at regional level starts to fade. So I think some differences in timing and so forth are to be understood."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (41:38);Jez, would you like to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jez Hemming: (41:39);Yeah, I would. Going back to what you’re saying about cooperation with the nations. Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford recently complained that Welsh government hadn’t had a conversation with the UK government for a week. Is the UK government simply leaving devolved nations to their own fate? And if not, what assistance is being provided?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (41:58);Well, I don’t think that’s right at all. If you look at the funding that’s been provided to all the devolved administrations, including the Welsh executive, I don’t think it’s true. If you look at the amount of PPE that we’ve helped deliver for nurses and others on the front line. I don’t know the last time that any one of the UK government spoke to the Welsh executive, but what I would say is that this challenge of as far as we possibly can, steering a UK wide approach whilst also recognizing the devolved competencies and the fact that judgments and the state of the virus will be different in different geographic parts of the UK is not unique to the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (42:38);If you look at Italy that they’ve experienced that, if you look at the, I spoke to my German opposite number recently, and he was explaining the different approaches taken in the different Lander states of Germany. It’s been true in France, they’ve got different geographic variations and variables at play. So, but we’ll work the best and certainly the best as we can, and certainly there is a huge repository of good will, I think that has been built up on both sides, and certainly from the UK government’s point of view, we want to continue that going forward. Please, Jonathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Jonathan Van Tam: (43:10);Could I add something? On the medical side, and I’m only talking about the medical side. I don’t recognize the position that you’ve outlined. My last conversation with the Welsh Medical Director in teleconference was late last week and my first one with him will I expect be this evening. And I know that our Chief Medical Officer for England is in pretty much daily contact with all of the devolved administration chief medical officers and that on very many things, they act as the four CMOs together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-18-dominic-raab","Dominic Raab: (43:49);Jez, thanks very much for that. Thanks everyone. That brings to a close today’s Downing Street press conference. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Thank you."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (00:03);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s briefing, where I’m joined by Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific advisor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (00:11);I want to begin by updating you on the latest data relating to the coronavirus outbreak. 2772552 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 89784 tests carried out yesterday. 248818 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 2412 cases since yesterday. 10025 people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus. That’s down 17% from the 11716 this time last week. And sadly, of those who’ve tested positive for coronavirus across all settings, 35341 have now died. That’s an increase of 545 fatalities since yesterday. And of course, our thoughts are with the families of all of those who lost their lives to this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (01:15);Before I turn to some of the work that DEFRA is doing to ensure that we are able to harvest this year’s farm harvest, I want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against the coronavirus. Firstly, on slide one, as you can see, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID alert system with five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (01:45);The alert level will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn, that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level, the fewer the measures, the higher the level, the stricter the measures. Throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March 23rd, we were at level four. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down, and we are now in a position to begin moving to level three in careful steps."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (02:23);Turning now to slide two, we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown and begin to allow people to return to their way of life. But crucially, do this while avoiding what would be a second peak that overwhelms the NHS. After each step, we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R value and the number of infections, and all the available data. And we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (03:01);So, in step one, as the prime minister announced last week, those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going to work, and people can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as they like. Finally, turning to slide three, having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice to people on what to do, our clear advice is to stay alert, control the virus and save lives. And staying alert means staying at home as much as possible and working from home if this is possible, limiting contact with other people, and where contact is made with other people, keeping your distance, washing your hands regularly, and also staying at home and self isolating if you or a household member show symptoms of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (03:57);My final point today relates to the availability of labor this year for the farming harvest. Every year, large numbers of people come from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to take part in the harvest, harvesting crops such as strawberries and salads and vegetables. We estimate that probably only about a third of the people that would normally come are already here, and small numbers may continue to travel. But one thing is clear, and that is that this year we will need to rely on British workers to lend a hand, to help bring that harvest home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (04:33);Over the last couple of months, we have been working with industry on a plan to support and help people taking second jobs, particularly those who are furloughed. And we have launched a new Pick for Britain website that enables people to go online, check what job issues there are, what job availability there is, and to marry up job opportunities from growers and employers with those people seeking a second job, particularly those that are furloughed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (05:04);And we believe that those who are furloughed may be getting to the point that they want to lend a hand and play their part. They may be wanting to get out and they may be wanting to supplement their income with an additional job. And if they do feel that way, I would urge them to visit that website and to look at the opportunities that are there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (05:25);I will now turn to Angela McLean who will give you further updates on the coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (05:30);Thank you. Pocket up the next slide, please. This slide shows the way people are moving around using their own cars, light goods vehicles, or heavy goods vehicles, or in public transport in the three graphs on the bottom. The data runs from the 16th of March to the 17th of May. And what we see is that, although there is some increase in the use of private cars and also in light goods vehicles and heavy goods vehicles that the reduction in the use of public transport, whether that be national rail, tube and buses in London, or buses elsewhere, fell very low and has stayed very low. That is very good news for all of us, because it means that people are continuing to respect the fact that, if we can, we must stay at home in order to prevent the transmission of this virus. Next slide please. So, this next slide in the top there in red shows the number of tests being done each day. And what you see is that it’s been very much higher, really, for the second half of that graph. So the graph runs from the 6th of April to the 19th of May. On the 19th of May, there were 89784 tests, and what that translates into is daily confirmed cases. So each day, how many people across all sorts of different settings had a positive test."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (07:09);It’s quite difficult to interpret that green graph because it’s in the context of lots of different people being allowed to be tested. And indeed, of course, lots and lots of extra testing become becoming available. And when I want to know what’s happening every day with coronavirus infections, if I go to the next slide, please, I turn to data from hospitals and the estimates of the number of new daily admissions into hospitals each day."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (07:41);So, we have this time series best for England, so we tend to look at the English data. And what you see there, that’s really the flow of infected people into hospitals, and it’s a therefore much more sensitive way of keeping track of what’s happening across the country. So, what you see is a graph that rose sharply from the beginning of March, thought it was already risen before then, and peaked on April the second. And that’s actually exactly the date that we would have expected it to peak, given the lockdown that we all took on board on the 23rd of March, and the fact that it would take about 10 days for that sudden drop in the number of new infections to turn into the sudden drop you see there in the number of people arriving in hospital with COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (08:29);And then what you see is that has fallen fairly steadily since then. It’s not falling quite as fast as it was right at the very beginning. And that is a cause for debate about why is that. And a different way of keeping track of how much infection is there in hospital is to look at the numbers of people who are really ill."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (08:54);So the bottom graph there is to do with people who need mechanical ventilation, so those are the people who are really most ill. And what it shows is, of all the facilities that we have, of all the beds in hospital where there is a mechanical ventilator, how many of them are being used by a patient who is infected with COVID?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (09:16);And what you see is that peaks, not surprisingly, a little bit later than the peak in new admissions, because of course you can only be a new admission once, but of course you can be in a hospital bed for lots and lots of days. And so you see that with a later peak, a flatter peak and a slower decline, but nevertheless, a sustained decline across all four of our nations. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (09:48);This breaks out the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 right across the UK. So we have it for the four nations of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, but England is then broken up into different regions. And you can see that there is a fair bit of variability across the different nations and the different regions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (10:12);What you see is that, for some regions, the number of people in hospital has fallen rapidly and is still falling quite rapidly. And for others, the number of people in hospital, whilst it’s still falling, is not falling as fast as in other places. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (10:37);Here we see people who have sadly died from COVID, with a confirmed positive test, here across the UK. This is the graph that we’re familiar with and we know that the numbers are always very low on Saturdays and Sundays. And for that reason, because this is very pronounced weekly pattern in the cases, we look instead of at the raw numbers, the blue bars, we look at the gold line and that’s a seven day rolling average. So we use that on purpose-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (11:03);… because we want to average out the weekend effect. And what you see with that rolling average, is that there is a steady decline in the number of confirmed COVID deaths here. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (11:24);There are several different ways of counting how many people have died because of this pandemic here in the UK. And here are a couple of different ones. So the first, the top graph there, went from the 14th of March to the 19th of May. And what it compares is ONS data on weekly deaths with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected, so that’s the higher purple line. Or weekly deaths with COVID confirmed with a positive test. So you can imagine that not everybody who is suspected of dying of COVID has actually had a positive test, that’s why the blue line lies underneath the purple line."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (12:07);And then the bar graph below it breaks those deaths out into deaths that occurred in hospital, deaths that occurred in care homes, at home, or in other places. And what we see is that every one of those different colored bars is now falling. Deaths in hospital is falling, deaths in care homes is also falling, and as are deaths at home and other deaths. So whilst we remain very sad, and really our hearts go out to the families of all those people, we do look at these falling deaths with some sense of relief that these numbers are consistently falling across sectors now. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (12:53);Thank you very much, Angela. Turning now to the first of our questions from the public. I think we have a video question from Kuljit."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Kuljit: (13:07);I’d like to understand what the UK government are doing in terms of gathering data and information from other countries across the world and Europe that have eased lockdown restrictions, in terms of taking lessons learned from their approach and using those on our own journey to easing the restrictions. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (13:26);Thank you very much, Kuljit, And I think that is a very important question. We’ve known from the beginning of this epidemic that we’ve been roughly two to three weeks behind Italy and France. We’ve seen the trajectory of the epidemic in those countries, seen how they responded. Many of the approaches that we’ve taken have obviously been very similar to those countries. And of course, in many other areas that we are considering now, including potentially having a quarantine at the border for arrivals, we’re also seeking to learn lessons from the approach taken from some of those other countries. I may ask whether Angela has any particular points she wants to add from an epidemiological point of view."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (14:10);I think that those points are very good, and that it’s obviously really, really important and a very good point, that we need to look to our near neighbors and also countries further away, to learn what works and how long it takes to see if something is working or not working. The two I would draw particular lessons from would be South Korea, where I feel they’ve made inspiring use of all kinds of different contact tracing, in order to control infection, to an extent that they are now down to handfuls of new cases every day. And when they say new cases, they mean people they’ve found in the community, because of their contact tracing efforts. And I think that is an experience that we are aiming to emulate. The other country I would look to is Germany, where the importance of testing has always been so clear. And that is a place from where we have learned that we need to grow our testing facility, and have grown our testing facility. Thank you, Kuljit."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (15:19);Thank you very much. And the next question we have, I think is a written one, which is from Nick from Gatwick. And his question is: “For those of us that work in sectors of which we cannot return to work, aviation, hospitality, et cetera. Will we see the government increasing the length of payment holidays for both mortgages and loans, to ensure we can financially weather this storm too?” And Nick, I think the point that I would make on this is that Rishi Sunak the chancellor, has announced an unprecedented and very comprehensive package to support both businesses during this time of crisis, but also employees that are affected. So businesses are able to access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan. And there have also been a number of other grants to help small businesses, and business rates have been set aside."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (16:13);And in the case of employees in those businesses, we’ve obviously had the furlough scheme, the job retention scheme. It’s now the case that around 8 million people are furloughed under that scheme. And I know that the chancellor is thinking very carefully about how that can evolve as we go through these various stages. Because it is the case, as you point out in your question, that there will be sectors in areas such as hospitality, or in the restaurant trade, or in aviation and others, where it’s very difficult for business to get back to anything close to normal for some time. And I know that the treasurer will be thinking very carefully about how the job retention scheme that we have can evolve to help support those businesses as they tentatively try to return to business in July. I will move on now to some of the questions from the journalists, starting with Sophie Hutchinson from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Sophie: (17:10);Good afternoon. You were just saying how inspired you are by South Korea and Germany, the contact tracing and testing that’s been going on there. Do you regret the decision that the government made in March to abandon that sort of tracing in the community?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (17:29);Well, I think the point that I would make on the testing and tracing is we’ve been expanding, ramping up that testing capacity over the last couple of months. We got it to 100,000 capacity by the end of April, we’re continuing to build that this week. Matt Hancock has made clear that anybody over the age of five with symptoms can get a test. And it’s also the case that we’ve now recruited over 20,000 people to assist with contact tracing, so that we can help track down infections on hotspots for this virus as we try to emerge from lockdown. I think it’s the case that early on in this epidemic, clearly there was a priority to make sure that people showing symptoms who worked in the NHS, because of their close proximity with patients, had those tests. So there was priority given to those, but we are now in the position where we’re able to offer testing to anybody over the age of five with symptoms. And that’s going to be quite crucial to developing our track and trace capabilities in the months ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (18:39);I think I would agree that at the time, with the testing we had, the right thing to do was to focus it on people who were really sick in hospital, so we knew who in hospital had COVID. So it was the right thing to do at the time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (18:52);Sophie, is there anything else you’d like to…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Sophie: (18:56);Yes. Just to ask, so you would agree therefore, that your strategy has been based on capacity rather than the science?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (19:06);Well, it’s undoubtedly the case that early on we were wanting to build that capacity, and we’ve pointed out before there were countries like Germany that naturally had more capacity existing in their economy. We were building it very rapidly from a very early stage, and we have now got to the point, as Matt Hancock pointed out this week, that we can offer test to anybody over the age of five with symptoms. And that’s going to be pretty critical in terms of developing that track and trace capability. Next we have John Ray, from ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","John Ray: (19:42);Hi there, good afternoon. A question to each of you please, about the return to school. I wonder if you both accept the deep, profound, and very sincere fears of teachers and parents about heading back to school at the beginning of June. And for you, Minister, this question: When so much has quite obviously gone wrong with the government’s leadership of this crisis, track and tracing, PPE, care homes, you can’t really blame teachers for not believing you when it comes to returning to school. And for the scientist, please: Frankly, isn’t it just too early to conclude that the science says that it’s safe to return to schools?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (20:35);Well John, it won’t surprise you to know that I don’t share your caricature of the government’s approach in this. Of course there have been challenges along the way in these extraordinary times we’re in, on a number of fronts. Other countries have experienced similar challenges. The government has grappled with what’s been a very difficult situation, and made timely decisions, and taken action to ensure that we had the capacity we needed to deal with this epidemic. And so for instance we constructed very quickly all of those Nightingale hospitals, that gave us that additional capacity should that have been needed, and the steps we took meant that we were able to flatten the curve of this virus, better than some had expected us to be able to."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (21:19);But on the specific issue of schools, we’re working very closely with the teaching unions and with school leaders on our approach to this. We do believe that it’s important that initially, we get the year ones and year sixes back into a school environment, to help prepare them for the move up to secondary school in the case of the latter, but also to help settle in the younger children in the former. And we do believe that other countries like Denmark have demonstrated how it’s possible, in fact, to bring schools back into opening, albeit in a socially distanced way, albeit with fewer pupils initially, and staggering-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (22:03);… the times that year groups arrive and so on. So other countries have demonstrated ways that this can be done and linking to the question that was raised by [inaudible 00:22:15] at the beginning of this question session, I think it is important that we learn from those other countries and that’s exactly what we’re trying to do. My final point is, we should bear in mind that throughout all of this crisis, I completely understand that there is apprehension and anxiety of those who are being asked to return to work, but there are some sectors like the NHS, like police, like the food sector, who have continued to work. And in the case of the food industry, have continued to work and done so successfully by putting in place social distancing measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (22:49);So we don’t underestimate that there are challenges and there is a job to do to reassure people, but we do believe it’s right to embark on this as other countries have. Angela, do you want to add anything?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (23:01);Yes. Thank you, John. Our scientist have been very clear on our advice that changes to lock down as we modeled them need a highly effective track, trace and isolate system to be in place. And we’re also very clear that any change to the social distancing measures should be based upon observed levels of incidents in places that those are going to be changed, not on a fixed state."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (23:26);Okay. John, is there anything else you wanted to…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","John Ray: (23:29);[inaudible 00:23:29] to each of you, to the scientists, as I understand it, the track and trace will not be fully in place by the 1st of June. So does that affect the scientific advice you’re giving? Will it be safe to reopen schools? And to you, minister, you seem to be accepting that the decision to send children back to school is not a scientific one, but a political calculation, even if that means that there is an aspect of risk for the children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (24:02);So we’re getting a full update on Thursday of exactly what’s going to be in place and when, so perhaps you seem to be party to knowledge that I’m not party to. So I’m going to wait to see what I get told on Thursday about what’s going to be in place by when."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (24:20);And John, look, it’s absolutely the case. As we evolve our policy from lockdown to something more nuanced with easements being progressively rolled out in several stages over the course of this summer, of course, absolutely, we are following the science on this. And just as other countries like Denmark, who’ve also embarked on a similar journey are also following the science. So I don’t accept that it’s putting the science to one side, but it is absolutely the case that all of us are going to have to live alongside this virus for some time to come. And we do need to try live our lives and identify ways of returning to work as far as possible, and to put in place those social distancing measures. And that’s what’s happened from day one in supermarkets, as people would have seen, it’s what’s happened in day one in the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (25:15);We’ve obviously been dealing with people affected by the virus and it’s the case that as other walks of life get back to something closer to normality, we do have to identify ways of doing that while observing the social distancing. The next question is Andy Bell from Channel 5."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Andy Bell: (25:36);Thank you very much. Today, the Chief Executive of Care England has told the parliamentary committee that people were discharged from hospital back into care homes when they were either symptomatic or simply didn’t have any COVID-19 status, they hadn’t been tested. Secretary of State, how was that allowed to happen as a policy. And Dame Angela, was there any scientific advice given at the time about doing that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (26:04);Well, look, we don’t accept the caricature that we took an approach that was wrong. Very early on in this epidemic, we had protocols in place for care homes. There was guidance as to how they should approach things as the situation developed. Then more stringent policies were introduced by way of policy around discharge. And we got to the point that everybody was tested before discharge, but in those early weeks, there will have been some instances where people may have been discharged who were asymptomatic. And there may have been a small number of instances where there may have been showing symptoms, but would have been isolated, and that was the guidance at the time that was in place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (26:51);But we have strengthened that very much ever since then, we now have testing and a very rigorous discharge policy that’s in place, and that is getting stronger all the time. And while it’s obviously a tragedy to see the number of deaths that we’ve had through this epidemic, it is reassuring, as Angela said earlier, that we’ve passed the peak epidemic that was taking place in care homes and the number of deaths and number of infections is now declining. Angela, would you like to add…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (27:21);I can’t answer that question without going back to the exact list of what advice was given when, and I don’t want to give you an answer that’s not correct. So if you’ll forgive me, could we take notice of that question? Is that okay? We can get back to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Andy Bell: (27:33);Well, yes, obviously, if you can get back, that would be very good. I mean, it leads on to another question I have, which is that, the chair of the Science and Technology Committee today has said that the advice given by scientists is too secretive in this whole process, that more should be published. I mean, do both of you think that would be a good idea? Do you think that would lead to better decision making?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (27:53);Well, I don’t really accept, Andy, that it secretive. We have been having these briefings on a daily basis for weeks and weeks now, and this is my fourth time doing this daily press conference. And at every one of those occasions, I’ve either had somebody from the Chief Scientific Adviser’s department or from Public Health England, or the NHS alongside me. And I think we’ve been very candid in sharing with people at every step of the way, exactly what we are doing and why we are doing it, and what the evidence shows, complete with graphs that show the trajectory and the trends and the epidemiology behind this outbreak."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (28:36);So I don’t really accept that criticism at all. I think we’ve been very candid throughout this in terms of sharing knowledge with people and sharing our approach with people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (28:52);We have been really very, very focused on trying to give really high quality advice, completely rooted in evidence. I can assure you that at every conversation, we are always challenging each other to say, what is the evidence for that? Our job is to give science advice here and make sure everything we say is rooted in good quality science. I have to admit that I haven’t spent much time worrying about how secretive or not secretive it is. I can see that is going to be a big issue when we have a big look back. I’d be more inclined to address that then. I realize that’s not what you want me to say, I know, but I don’t think that’s the most interesting conversation, I would say. I say the most interesting conversation is, are we able to give good advice?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (29:42);Thank you so much. Next, we have Jane Merrick from The i."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Jane Merrick: (29:45);Thank you. I want to follow up on Sophie’s question, first of all, to Dame Angela. In February, a WHO China report said that community testing and contact tracing was the best way to tackle coronavirus. So was the decision then on the 12th of March to scale back on community testing and contact tracing in the UK, was that based on sound scientific advice? And to the Secretary of State, who takes ultimate responsibility for these decisions and for that decision on the 12th of March? Is it the ministers or the scientists offering the advice?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (30:25);The advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available. It was what was the best thing to do with the test that we had. We could not have people in hospital with COVID symptoms, not knowing whether or not they had COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (30:42);And as I explained earlier, Jane, we have been expanding dramatically our testing capacity over recent weeks and months, simply because it is going to be a very important feature of that track and trace approach that we’re developing, and we’ve recruited now over 20 traces to work on that. And as we evolve this policy and emerge from full lockdown to something where we try to support people getting back to work normally, having that track and trace approach is going to be increasingly important and that’s why we are increasing that capacity. As I pointed out earlier, at the beginning of this, when there was an issue of capacity on tests, then of course you needed to prioritize where those tests were most needed, and that was in our NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (31:34);You couldn’t have a situation where people working in the NHS did not know whether they had the coronavirus or not. So it was right to initially prioritize the tests for that particular outcome."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Jane Merrick: (31:50);If I could follow up, just to go back to Dame Angela, I mean, your colleague, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the science committee on the 25th of March that he wished that there was more capacity available. So are you saying then that even given sort of the international expertise on coronavirus, it was just what was available at the time, the capacity that was available at the time, that was the best advice that you could give in the context of that capacity?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (32:17);I think that’s what I just said, yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (32:21);Okay. Right. Thank you very much, Jane. And next we have Stephan from City A.M."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Stefan: (32:28);Thank you, Secretary of State. David Frost and the UK Brexit negotiating team have said on multiple occasions that one of the key contentions areas, sorry, of negotiations has been fishing policy. And that if there isn’t any movement on these talks by June, that the deal will be unlikely to go through. This would mean that the city of London is locked out of lucrative EU markets. With this in mind, can you tell me what the government is prioritizing higher? The city of London and financial services firms, which contribute 7% of GDP to the economy or the fishing industry, which contributes-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Stefan: (33:03);… 0.1%. And to Dame Angela, is there any chance of the lockdown being lifted entirely in remote islands or isolated communities in the UK who haven’t had any recorded cases of COVID-19?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (33:18);Thank you very much, Stefan. The short answer is that we, in this negotiation, are prioritizing becoming an independent self-governing country again. We want to make our own decisions, make our own laws, control our own waters. Yes, set our own fishing policy, have a seat at the table where fishing opportunities are negotiated each year, not only with our EU members, but also with countries such as Norway and the [inaudible 00:00:49]. And we believe that the interests of our economy are best served by us taking back control and making our own laws again. And that is the approach we’re taking."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (33:59);And so, as David Frost has pointed out, there are a couple of sticking points so far in these negotiations. One is that the European Union seemed to be insisting that we continue to abide by their laws even after we’ve left. And the second is that the European Union seemed to be saying that uniquely among every other country in the world, the UK should give unlimited access to its waters for EU countries even though we’re not any longer part of the Common Fisheries Policy. And both of those, as a point of principle, are wrong. And that is why we’ve adopted the stance that we have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (34:39);Well, as you know, you can’t ask me what policy might be, but you can ask me what kind of question are scientists looking at? And I can tell you for sure, location is a huge focus of ours at the moment. Of course, I mean, islands are a very special case, which is, of course, particularly interesting. But there are also other parts of the country that have the spread of infection across the country is really quite diverse, quite heterogeneous. And that does, of course, raise interesting questions, particularly as we get incidents right right down about what should we do about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (35:11);Stefan, did you want to come back again?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Stefan: (35:14);Thank you. I just want to come back to you, Secretary of State. I do understand the rationale for the fishing policy and negotiations that are going by, but can you say today definitively if they will not be softened for the sake of financial services firms, which contribute so much to the UK economy getting access to a market, which is so important for them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (35:33);Well, look, I just think in this approach, it’s very important that you’re clear about your priorities. And one of ours is to become an independent coastal state in control of our own waters again, and managing and controlling access to our waters. That’s been our position from the very beginning and it will not change. And I think it’s not something to get into to be saying you have to sacrifice one industry in order to give a leg up to another. That’s not the way to approach this negotiation. The way to approach it is to stand up for our interest as an independent country. And that’s the approach that we are taking. Now next we have Ben Fishwick from Portsmouth News."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Ben Fishwick: (36:21);Thank you, Secretary of State. And even with extra government funding, councils are struggling to cover their increased costs during this crisis. Can you commit to matching pound for pound their expenditure and cover any budget shortfalls caused by loss of income? And then separately on testing, we have a testing center in Portsmouth, but several of our readers who were tested on the 1st of May waited for two weeks for a result despite being told it would be arriving in 48 to 72 hours later. 14 days after their test, several of them were told their results were unclear. Is there the capability to ensure a proper turnaround of testing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (37:00);Well, Ben, on your latter point, we do recognize that there have been a few reports of people not getting the results to their tests as quickly as they would expect. And it’s also the case that there are instances where a test result comes back as inconclusive and sometimes second tests have to take place. And I might ask Angela in a moment to say a bit more on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (37:24);On your former point about local authorities, of course the government recognizes that this coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on local authorities. We’ve recognized that, and we’ve given them an additional 3.2 billion pounds to help them cope with the new burdens that have been in place. We’ve also made available 600 million pounds to support care homes and help them respond to this crisis. So yes, we recognize that there are new burdens on local authorities as a result of this. And we’ve put in place some additional funding to recognize that. And I completely appreciate that local authorities will always say that they need further funding. And in situations like this, they will have funds set aside for events of this sort. And we think that the approach that we’ve taken with that 3.2 billion pound injection is the appropriate intervention from government to support them in the really important work that they’re doing. Angela, did you want to add anything on the …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (38:34);I think really running a rapid and reliable testing system is an entirely operational issue. And so the science advice would be you need to have a rapid and reliable testing system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (38:50);Okay. Ben, is there any final thing you want to know?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Ben Fishwick: (38:54);Are you confident we do have a rapid and reliable testing system?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Angela McLean: (38:57);I think it’s getting better. And one of the things we’ve actually looked at a lot today is evidence from other countries. And it clearly is possible to set up testing systems with a 48 hour turnaround."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","George Eustice: (39:13);Okay. Thank you very much, Ben. And thank you to everyone for those questions. I think we’ve covered a large amount of ground today, but thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-19-with-george-eustice","Speaker 2: (39:25);So that’s the end of today’s Downing Street briefing on coronavirus. Let’s just take you through some of the main points that were covered there in that Downing Street briefing led by the Environment Secretary, George Eustice, who announced that there had been a further 545 COVID-19 deaths confirmed with a positive test in the last day. Now that means the official number of people across the UK who are known to have died with the virus is 35,341. In terms of tests, 89,784 tests were provided in the last day. Now you remember the government has promised to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April and 200,000 by the end of May as well. And the Environment Secretary said that farmers will need more help from British workers this year to bring in the harvest. He said he hopes British workers will be able to find jobs on farms via a new online recruitment hub called Pick for Britain. He urged furloughed and unemployed workers to sign up to help get the harvest in."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (00:00);Welcome to today’s briefing. I’m pleased to be joined by professor Steve Powis, the National Medical Director at NHS England. First of all, I would like to update you on the latest data in respect of the coronavirus response. So, first of all, 2,962,227 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the United Kingdom. And that includes 177,216 tests, which were carried out yesterday. 248,293 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,472 cases since yesterday. 9,953 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus that is down 13% from 11,443 this time, last week. And sadly of those who have tested positive for coronavirus across all settings, 35,704 have now sadly died. That is an increase of 363 fatalities since yesterday. And of course my thoughts are with every one of the families of those people who’ve been affected by this. And before we begin questions from the public and from the media, I just want to remind people of the details of the next phase of our fight against coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (01:26);So slide one, please. So as you’ll see from slide one first in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new covert alert level system with five levels. Each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The alarm system will be based primarily on the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that alert level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place, the lower the level, the fewer the measures, the higher the level, the stricter the measures. And throughout the period of lockdown, which started on March the 23rd, we’ve been at level four, but thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we’ve helped to bring the R level down and we’re now in a position to begin moving to level three in careful steps, may we have slide two, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (02:18);So as you’ll see from this slide, we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures. Gradually ease the lockdown and begin to allow people to return to their normal way of life. But crucially avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak, which overwhelms the NHS. And after each step, we will closely monitor the impact of that step on R and the number of infections and all the available data. And we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so. So step one, as the prime minister announced this week, those who cannot work from should now speak to their employer about going back to work, you can spend time outdoors and exercises often as you like, and you can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor public place provided that you stay two meters apart."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (03:14);Slide three, please. So as you’ll see from slide three, having taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures and our advice on what people can do, we’ve also updated what we are asking people to do, which is to stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Yes, staying alert for the vast majority of people still mean staying at home as much as possible, but there are a range of other actions that we’re advising people to take."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (03:44);So people should stay alert by working from home if you can, limiting contact with other people, keeping distance if you go out two meters apart where possible and washing your hands regularly, wearing face covering when you’re in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant. So for example, in some shops and on public transport and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self isolate because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus. Now over the past months, we’ve all naturally been focused on the huge life or death health implications of this pandemic. But I’d now like to provide an update on some of the crucial work taking place behind the scenes to support and protect the things that give our lives added, meaning such as sport, art, tourism, and our charities, music and theaters. And when we look back on the coronavirus, one of the things we’ll remember is the incredible contribution made by so many people. And there’s a way of showing our national gratitude to these everyday covert heroes. We’re announcing today that we’re delaying her majesty, the Queen’s birthday honors list until the autumn so that they can be recognized and celebrated."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (05:15);And that’s the prime minister said today, I’m delighted that her majesty, the queen has approved a knighthood for captain Tom Moore in recognition of his outstanding achievements in raising nearly 33 million pounds for NHS charities. And captain Tom sat a marker of generosity and the public have matched it. Incredibly now looks as if British people and businesses have now contributed over 800 million pounds and that’s just through national fundraising campaigns alone. And a great deal more has obviously been raised at local levels. And as the British people have generously given their time and their money, the government has sought to back them every step of the way. So we promised to match every penny raised by the BBC’s big night in campaign. And after a fantastic public response, I’m delighted to announce today that over 70 million pounds is now being distributed by Comic Relief, Children in Need and the National Emergencies Trust to charities on the front line."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (06:15);Now this comes on top of the hundreds of millions of pounds we’ve already announced. The charity is doing vital work to support those suffering from poor mental health, to help the victims of domestic abuse and to make sure hospices can continue to care for families in these most difficult circumstances. And today I’m pleased to confirm the government’s dedicated support scheme for small and medium sized charities, the coronavirus community support fund will open for applications this week. Initially there’ll be a 200 million pound trunch of government funding, and this will be administered by the national lottery community fund. And this will focus on those charities we may not know nationally, but who are lifeline to communities at a local level. And on top of that, I can also announce today that we’re releasing 150 million pounds from dormant accounts to help social enterprises get affordable credit to people who are financially vulnerable and to support charities tackling youth unemployment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (07:15);So our charities both large and small have really been at the forefront of this national effort to defeat the coronavirus and together all of this amounts to a multibillion pound boost for Britain’s charities. And I know that people are also eager for news of the return of light sports and the arts. And I know that the last few months it felt rather odd without them and now our calendars have been strangely bare. Finding creative crowd free ways to navigate coronavirus is the biggest challenge for our recreation and leisure sectors right now. So this week I’m setting up a renewal task force, which will help them bounce back. It will be made up of the brightest and the best from creative tech and sporting worlds. These are experts in their field and they’ll be advising me on how they find new and different ways to get industries back up and running."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (08:05);And just to give a few examples, it includes Alex Scott, a former lioness and olympian and now in an award winning broadcaster. And she will help us think through how we can get support back safely in a way that works for both clubs, players and supporters alike. Similarly, lord Grade, former chairman of both the BBC and ITV, will provide an insight as to how we get our creative media industries back up and flourishing again. And Tamara Rojo the English National Ballet artistic director will give us ideas for how we start to get our art scene back up and running. And Martha Lane Fox a well known as founder of lastminute.com will advise on how tech can power all of this recovery across all these sectors, but particularly in tourism as part of the much wider role it will play in driving our economy forward as it has done already."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (08:57);Meanwhile bit by bit, we are developing guidance that’s helping some of the lighter bits of our economy return to this new normal. So we had supported the safe return of TV production, meaning our broadcasters are able to keep some of our favorite shows back on the TV screens, whether that’s [inaudible 00:09:15], we’ve helped to reopen the country’s tennis and basketball courts and guided athletes back into training safely. And that in turn will pave the way for the return of live sports behind closed doors in the near future. Normal life as we’ve known it is still clearly a long way off and the path to get there is a narrow one. But these things will return when it’s safe for them to do so and thanks to the same drive and creativity that makes a great performance or a great piece of art. And I really think that when they do and when we’ve overcome this crisis together, we’ll appreciate them that much more. And with that, I’ll hand over to professor Steve Powis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (09:57);Thank you very much secretary of state and good afternoon. If I could go through the data slides for today, with which I’m sure you have become familiar. So the first slide shows information on social distancing and how the British public have responded to the requests that we all socially distance in order to reduce the rate at which the virus, the coronavirus is transmitted through our communities. And as I’ve said before, it’s only by doing that, that we will keep this under control, that we will reduce the number of deaths that we have unfortunately seen and the number of admissions to the NHS and the pressure on the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (10:33);So this slide shows a number of graphs data from both vehicle mobility, so transporting cars and like vehicles and heavy goods vehicles and you can see there has been a slow increase in vehicle movements, probably recently reflecting the desire for people who can return to work, who can’t work from home returning. But on public transport, national rail transport for London and bus outside of London, you can see that the levels of usage are still very low and very much down on what they were before social distancing measures were introduced. So again, evidence that the British public has responded to and complied with the instructions that we’ve all been given."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (11:21);On the next slide, we start to look at testing and the number of new cases that are test positive. And as you’ve heard from the secretary of state, there has been an increase in recent weeks, both in the capacity of testing and in the number of people who are being tested. And you can see that at the graph at the start. We’re now nearly up to 3 million tests that have been performed in total. In the lower graph, you can see the number of daily confirmed cases. And again, as I’ve said recently, that although the testing capacity has increased and the number of tests has increased, the number of daily confirmed cases has not increased. And in fact, it’s stable or perhaps even falling. And I think that shows that the amount of transmission, the amount of virus in the community is falling and with an hour rate, less than one, that is exactly what we would expect."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (12:12);In the next slide, we’ll see how that translates into the usage of hospitals. Now, once again, for the vast majority of people, this is a mild illness that does not require hospital care, but for minority of people unfortunately, hospital admission is required. And for the sickest, of course, that might require a period on our intensive care units. So this shows the new daily admissions with COVID-19 from March through to now and you can see that, that is on a decline. So we are seeing fewer and fewer daily admissions, again, showing the benefits of social distancing. And then in the bottom graph, you can see that group of individuals who unfortunately our sickest and require ventilation. So they need to be put on a ventilator and mechanically ventilated. Those obviously occurs in our intensive care units and those areas that we are using as part of our expanded capacity to do this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (13:09);And you can see again, that that number is falling across all parts of the UK again, reflecting the benefits of social distancing. Next slide shows more data in hospital. And I would highlight that the number of people in hospital is now below 10,000. So I think that’s the first time since March that we have seen a fall that has come down below 10,000 in terms of the people who are actively in hospital with a tests positive for COVID-19. You can see in the individual charts showing various parts of the UK, that the fall, the decline has been steepest in London that had the highest peak, but also you will see declines in other areas of the country at different rates, but all heading surely in the right direction. So a fall in the number of people in hospital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (14:03);And then in the next slide, finally, we show the number of deaths and you have heard the numbers for today. Clearly, it’s with great sadness that we report these deaths, but you see on a daily basis that looking at the key figure, the seven day rolling average, which takes out the variation between days and particularly the reporting variation of weekends, you can see that the trend is now consistently downwards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (14:26);And that will continue to fall as long as we all comply with the instructions that we’ve been given around social distancing. So this is not the time to, as I said before, to become complacent about this. Yes, if you can’t work at home, then talk to your employer about getting to work. But we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert and we need to make sure that we keep that important zero, but our number below one, so that the rate of transmission is continually declining in the population. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (14:59);Thank you, and thank you very much for that very clear presentation. We now turn to questions. First of all, we’re going to go to Thomas from the Northwest and he’s joining us by video."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Thomas: (15:11);Good afternoon, please can you give an update on what the UK is doing to help the poorer nations through this pandemic? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (15:23);Well, thank you very much for that question, Thomas. And it’s a really important question. The first thing that we’ve done to help poorer nations is we’re standing by our commitment to the poorest nations by devoting north.7% of our entire national income to going to aid."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (15:38);And that despite all the challenges we have faced during the coronavirus and all the pressures on public spending, we are maintaining that commitment. And I know there’s a lot of concern about where the poorer nations are going to be able to access vaccines. That’s why through the [inaudible 00:15:53] program, we were also ensure that we get those vaccines at an affordable level, working with our aid budget, to those poorest nations, fulfilling I think what we’ve always done as a nation. We’ve always stood by the poorest nations in time of need. And I think that’s part of the moral responsibility we show as a nation."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (16:12);I think now we have question number two, and that is from Heather in Devon. So just to read that out, Heather asks, I like many others have had medical reviews delayed as nurses who conducted them were redeployed to the frontline and they’re currently still working in hospitals. How long will it be before those NHS staff can go back to their normal jobs?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (16:34);Well, first of all, I’d like to pay tribute, Heather, to all of the nurses and other frontline staff in the NHS who’ve done so much during this crisis to help us tackle it. And through that crisis and thanks to their hard work, we have avoided the NHS being overwhelmed, but clearly in moving that capacity to the frontline to deal with coronavirus, it has had [inaudible 00:16:59] consequences elsewhere. As we now move out of the peak and we’re working with cost to ensure that we don’t have a second peak where the NHS is overwhelmed, there is more capacity again, so we can start delivering more capacity to deal with these sorts of challenges, but Professor Powis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (17:14);Yes. So thank you, Heather and I too would like to pay tribute to all my colleagues in the NHS who’ve worked so magnificently over the last few months to deal with the surge in patients that we’ve seen with COVID-19. And it is the case that some of those staff have had to be redeployed. They’ve had to work in different areas, and sometimes they’ve had to work with a set of skills that they have, but they haven’t had to use in recent years. And I think it’s been truly inspiring the way people have stood up and taken that task and delivered for the public in this country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (17:49);As I’ve said many times before, in the NHS, we have kept our emergency services going throughout this. And so if you have symptoms that you’re worried about, maybe symptoms of you’re worried about heart attack or a stroke. If you’ve got a child with severe asthma, then don’t be afraid to use the NHS as you always used it. It is still there for you. Yes, we are managing and have been managing an increased number of people with COVID-19, but the NHS is there for emergency conditions. And it’s really important you don’t delay getting in touch with us through 111, through calling your GP. Or in extreme circumstances, dialing 999."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (18:27);We’ve also kept services such as cancer going throughout this. There has been some disruption and some patients I know have been advised by their clinicians not to have treatment immediately, because for instance, if their immune system is being treated as part of their cancer treatment is being depressed, then there may be a reason not to do that at a time when a virus is circulating."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (18:54);But now that we’ve come over the peak, we are in a position as the Secretary of State said to start to build up those NHS services where we’ve had to redeploy staff and perhaps that we have had to delay. So you will see over the next weeks and months standing up of all those NHS services so that the routine reviews can start to be done again. But I’m sure everybody understands that at a time of public emergency, where we saw that surge in the virus over April, it was the right thing to do to make sure that our staff were focused on the response to that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (19:31);But now we can start to get back towards normal, although a new normal, because we will have to do that in the context of still having some underlying COVID-19 in the community."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (19:43);Thank you. And now I think we come to the next question and that’s from Nick [inaudible 00:19:47] for the BBC, Nikki there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Nick: (19:49);Thank you. I have a question for you, Secretary of State and a question for Professor Powis. So Oliver Dowden, in his televised addressed earlier this month, the prime minister talked about the awful epidemic in care homes. And this morning, your cabinet colleague Robert Buckland acknowledged that care homes were given less priority for testing than the NHS at the start of this crisis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Nick: (20:13);And then he said, sadly, there were far too many cases of infection and deaths in care homes, and yet at Prime Minister’s questions today, Boris Johnson appeared to brush aside concerns and questions about the level of testing in the early stages of this public emergency. So what is it? Gloss over possible mistakes in the past or face up to the fact as Robert Buckland said that maybe things could have been done differently."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Nick: (20:43);And for Professor Powis, can I ask you your scientific colleague dame Angela McLean said yesterday in answer to a question if all the schools can open on the 1st of June, she said that you need to have a highly effective track, trace, and isolation system in place. Today, the prime minister said that there will be a test, track, and trace system. It will be in place he said by the 1st of June."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Nick: (21:09);Now, given that they have been moving about on the dates about when this might happen from ministers, are you confident Professor Powis that the McLean conditions will be met given that there are concerns over the app? And whilst there will be 25,000 trackers who will be able to track 10,000 cases a day. And yes, that is four times the number of confirmed cases, that is probably well below the number of actual cases in the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (21:40);Well, thank you for that question, Nick. Perhaps I deal with the first one about glossing over and then handover to you, Professor Powis. It is categorically not the case that we have glossed over this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (21:50);The prime minister has been very clear about the challenges that we face in care homes. And of course, every death in the care home is one to many, but that is precisely why we’ve introduced this care home action plan. That means there’s more money going into care homes. For example, an extra 600 million pounds was announced very recently. That’s why we’re ramping up the testing in care homes. That’s why we’re ramping up the protective equipment for care homes. Why, for example, we’ve introduced a dedicated hotline so that they can get that protective equipment into care homes. And actually as a result of those measures, whilst the numbers remain too high, the indicators suggest that we are moving in the right direction, where that is reducing number of deaths or reducing number of new infections. [inaudible 00:22:35] Powis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (22:35);Yes. So maybe going back to the first principle about the overall strategy. What’s important is to keep the R number below one, as I said a little bit earlier, because it’s only by keeping the R below one that the rate of transmission falls in the community."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (22:54);In other words, the amount that is being passed on from person to person is less than one on average. And therefore the infection rate is going down and you achieve that in a variety of ways and track and trace is one component of the measures that will need to be kept in place, at least in the foreseeable future to ensure that R is below one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (23:14);So the first point I’d make is, as Angela said yesterday, a track and trace and an effective track and trace strategy in place is a very important component of keeping the infection under control, but it’s not the only thing. It needs to be seen combined with other social distancing measures. But over time, as the strategy towards virus in the community evolves may be relaxed, but track and trace is not the only thing that needs to be in place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (23:46);And I think as the government has said, clearly timing is an issue for government. We can advise, but it’s a question for governments. I know the government would want to see, and I think they’ve said that they need to have the context that there will not be a rise of R above one in order to move in the subsequent steps of any release of lockdown measures. So track and trace. Yes, very important. But it’s just one of the measures that we will need to keep in place going forward to ensure that transmission rates stay below one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (24:20);Nick, would you like to ask any followups?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Nick: (24:23);Yes. Could I just come back to you, Oliver Dowden? You’re saying that you’re not glossing over anything, but there was a very different tone from Robert Buckland today when he was saying maybe things could have been done differently. And it’s well known that mistakes, honest mistakes may well have been made, particularly in the beginning phase of this public emergency. And wouldn’t it do this government some good, wouldn’t it do the government scientists some goods, if you follow the example of Emmanuel Macron and acknowledged, admitted, open about those. There’s going to be a public inquiry. You’re going to be called up before that public inquiry. So why not begin that conversation now?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (25:02);Well, of course in any public health crisis, like this, there’ll be a time for lessons to be learned afterwards, but I think the public rightly want us now to be focusing on dealing with this. That is why we have introduced the NHS care homes action plan, having the consequences I described. And on some of the points you raised, for example, in relation to people who have been discharged from hospitals into care homes, actually the number’s discharged in March, April were 40% lower than those in January. And it has been the case that testing has been available to care homes, right from the very beginning. And it has been the case that we have issued guidance, right from the very, very beginning. Of course, there are always lessons to be learned, but I think it is worth reflecting on those things. Thank you for that question. Now over to Robert Peston."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Robert Peston: (25:50);Good afternoon. Remarkable data out of public health England today. The last 24 hours or the latest 24 hour period, there were zero cases of coronavirus or new cases in London. So presumably there will be a return to school in the capital, at least for the youngest children and more stores opening, at least in the capital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Robert Peston: (26:13);And a separate one for Professor Powis, the prime minister today said in the House of Commons that no older people will return to care homes without the approval of a clinician, which seems to many as though the prime minister is in a sense passing the blame for seeding COVID-19 in care homes to doctors or nurses. What do you think of that, Professor Powis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (26:39);Well, perhaps, should I start with your first question, Robert, about the opening up process and you referenced some of the promising figures. It is worth reflecting again on those tests numbers, where we’re now up to 177,216 tests. So it’s not just the numbers that are moving in the right direction, of course we have to be highly cautious about it, but also the government response continues to ramp up."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (27:03);Now the prime minister set out the path that we will go down in terms of easing the lockdown. He set out this three stage process. The next stage, and we’ve said from the earliest will be from the beginning of June, we will look at some of the measures that you discussed around, for example, opening up non-essential retail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (27:24);In respect to the question about schools. I really think we should try and open schools if we possibly can. And a lot of work. I know my friend the education secretary has put a lot of work, as indeed has the health secretary about thinking about how we can do that safely, whether that is staggering entry times, whether it is keeping children together in groups of 15. And the reason for doing all of that is because I think there’s very strong evidence that particularly for the most disadvantaged children in those early years, it’s not cost-free for them not going to school. There is a cost. So if we can get them back in a way that we safely can do so, we should do so, but it will only be guided by the evidence that is moving in-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (28:03);… the right direction at the moment, but we’ll be very cautious about that. Stephen, is there anything you want to?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (28:08);Thank you, Robert. So I was a front line doctor for many, many years, and I wouldn’t discharge a patient from a hospital into whatever setting, home or care home, unless I was absolutely confident that their medical treatment was complete and they no longer required hospital treatment. And indeed, I think it’s always worth making the point that particularly for our elderly population, remaining in hospital when your medical hospital treatment is complete, can be harmful to individuals. So I’m absolutely sure that my medical colleagues would not be discharging patients under any circumstances, unless they were sure that their medical treatment in hospital was complete, they were fit for discharge and it was safe to discharge them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (28:51);Robert, any follow ups you want to ask?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Robert Peston: (28:53);Well yes, just on the return of children to schools and non essential stores, are you allowing the possibility that this could happen on a region by region basis? Because as I say, if there are literally no new cases in London, there’s a very strong argument that even if other parts of the country are not ready for children to go back and the rest, London is ready."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (29:14);Well look, we want to proceed as fast as we safely can do so. Because clearly there are benefits in the way I described for children and there are clearly benefits for the wider economy and people’s public utility, really of being able to access those non-essential retail. I think it is best though, and the government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation and that would include of course the whole of England in doing so. It may be the case that because of the track and trace, clearly within track and trace, if we identify specific very micro hotspots, then we would have different measures in respective of that. But the clear intention is that we move as a whole country. Thank you for your question. Now over to Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Ben Kentish: (30:02);Thank you Secretary of State, good afternoon. Three weeks ago on the steps of Downing Street, the Prime Minister talked to the need for the maximum possible transparency and promised that the government would share all it’s working and thinking with the British people. And yet now you’re asking parents to send their children back to school without having published the scientific advice on whether it is safe for them to do so. In effect, asking them to simply take someone else’s word for it. If you were a parent without the benefit of being a government minister, would you want to see that advice? And when will the government fulfill the Prime Minister’s transparency pledge by publishing it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Ben Kentish: (30:38);And just a quick second one, if I may, under the government’s bereavement scheme, the families of frontline doctors and nurses who lose their life fighting coronavirus will be given indefinite leave to remain in the UK, but it was confirmed last night that the families of porters, carers and cleaners who died in similar circumstances will not. Does the government think the lives of carers, porters and cleaners are worth less than those of doctors and nurses, or is there another reason for that discrepancy? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (31:08);Okay. Thank you for your questions. There’s two questions wrapped up in there. So I might resist going back for a further one. In terms of the point about parents sending their children back to school, I’m a dad of two primary school aged children. And I do of course, genuinely understand parents’ concerns around this and they will want to be sure that if they send their children back to school, they do so in a safe environment. But that is why the Education Secretary has been working so hard to ensure that we do develop that safe environment, whether that is staggered entry, whether it’s washing hands, whether it is having children kept within groups so that they don’t mix with others. All of those are driven by the evidence about how to do this in the most safe way possible. We won’t proceed unless we can be sure of children’s safety. Of course, that goes without saying. In relation to your point about the publication of the evidence, SAGE advice is being published routinely, and there was some further advice published on Friday, and that will continue to be the case."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (32:14);In respect of the points you rightly raised about support for care workers and others. First of all, just to restate what I said earlier in this press conference that all of us, owe a huge debt of gratitude to everyone working in the NHS. We all go out and clap at eight o’clock on Thursday evenings to show that appreciation. One of the measures we’ve taken to show that appreciation is the bereavement support, which is available to everyone, of course, including porters and others who make such a huge contribution. In respect to your point about the indefinite leave to remain. We do keep that policy under review and we will look further into that case. Now I think we’ll go over to Jason Groves."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Ben Kentish: (33:00);Can I just follow up on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (33:00);Yes, go on quickly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Ben Kentish: (33:01);Thank you. I wondered if Professor Powis had a view on whether the bereavement scheme should be extended to all NHS workers and just on the schools point, Secretary of State, just want to follow up on Nick’s point really, will the contact tracing system be in place together with the app by the start of June, as Angela McLean suggested yesterday was necessary. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (33:22);Okay. So I’ll try to remember those further points. So in respect of the contact tracing, the Prime Minister announced fantastic progress at lunchtime today. We’ve now recruited 25,000 contact tracers that will enable us to undertake 10,000 traces. Now, given that we are currently at the stage where there’s 2,400 cases, that is huge progress and that would be by the beginning of June. So that is really important progress."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (33:55);In respective the indefinite leave to remain. I know that we owe hospitals and others that huge debt of gratitude and that’s why I said what I said about keeping the policy under review. But is there anything else you want to?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (34:08);Well, I think that’s a matter for government in terms of keeping the policy under review, but all I can say is, again, as a doctor, who’s worked on the front line for many years, how much I value the entire multidisciplinary team. So everybody from porter, to manager, to administrator, to nurse, who absolutely work together as a team in managing this sort of crisis, but also in the day to day care that the NHS provides. So it’s often the doctors and nurses who are at the front and get the praise. But believe me, there are a huge number of people working behind the scenes. I was at the Royal Free when we managed Ebola. And I will always remember the photograph in the Evening Standard that showed the huge team of people, the engineers who kept the plant open being some of the ones that I remember the most, who kept the show on the road and allowed those patients to be treated successfully and that is the case now. There are many, many heroes within the NHS, not just doctors and nurses."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (35:11);Thank you. Now we go on to Jason Groves from the Daily Mail."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Jason Groves: (35:16);Thanks. Mr. Dowden, the TV has been a lifeline for lots of older people through this lockdown. I wonder if you’re happy to see the over 75s lose their free TV license in August and whether you might intervene or whether that’s a job for the BBC. And Professor Powis, I wonder if I could ask you about the two meter rule. We heard from Robert Dingwall, who’s a government advisor earlier, that the actual scientific evidence for keeping us two meters apart rather than one is very fragile. Has he got a point, you’re on SAGE, given the importance of that to sectors like education and hospitality, could you look at it again?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (35:59);Well, shall I deal with the BBC and TV license first? Look, we were clear and we’ve been clear all along that we didn’t want the BBC to take away the free TV license from the over 75s. I think the BBC made absolutely the right decision in saying that in the middle of this coronavirus crisis, when particularly older people are being asked to self isolate and who are feeling lonely, often the TV is a lifeline for them. It wouldn’t have been acceptable to take away that TV license, which is why they rightly extended the proposal for moving it to the beginning of August. I very much hope that if we are in the similar situation come the beginning of August, the BBC will show similar flexibility again."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (36:45);So on the two meter rule. So I can absolutely assure you that SAGE does keep things under review, not least because the science is constantly evolving. And as we learn more about this virus and it’s quite right that as scientists, we consider new evidence and keep things under review. The current advice is two meters. I’m sure that along with a whole host of other things that will constantly be kept under review as new evidence emerges."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (37:13);Okay. Jason, any follow ups to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Jason Groves: (37:16);Yeah. Well, we don’t get you very often, Secretary of State."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (37:18);It’s meant to be a follow up, not a new question, but go on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Jason Groves: (37:21);I’m going to ask you a new question anyway, about tourism. Is there any chance of us getting a holiday in Britain this summer, and if we can, would you encourage people to take a stay cation?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (37:29);Yeah, look, I love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We’ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. We’re working hard to be able to deliver on that, that is partly why I’ve set up this task force I announced at the beginning of this press conference. Bringing together experts, not just the people that I named at the beginning, when you see the full list, there’s other people from the tourism sector who will help advise on that. Clearly we can only do it if it’s safe to do so, because I think the worst thing for our tourism sector would be to start, then see the R rate rise out of control, see a second peak that overwhelms the NHS that we then have to slam on the brakes again. But believe me, we get to the point when we can have British tourism back, apart perhaps from the Prime Minister, you won’t find a bigger champion of the Great British Break than me. Thank you, over to Jane Kirby for PA."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Jane Kirby: (38:27);Thank you and good afternoon. Many football fans are hoping that the Premier League will return next month. Will the government be asking that these matches are available on free to air terrestrial television, or is it acceptable for existing rights holders, such as Sky and BT, just to stream the matches on their YouTube platforms? And isn’t it vital that these matches are shown on terrestrial to encourage people to adhere to the lockdown. And a question for Professor Powis please on antibody testing, antibody tests are becoming much more widely available on commercial websites. Should people be buying these tests to use at home, or is the intention that they will get one via the NHS for free at some point? And if so, when might that be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (39:06);Shall I take the Premier League first? So, as I said several times before, I’m really keen that if we can get the Premier League back behind closed doors, we should do that. The process for doing this is really threefold. So first of all, we’ve already issued the guidance for carrying out training behind closed doors. That’s non-contact training, those guidelines have already been published earlier this week. I hope, subject to the sign off by Public Health England and others, we will then, later this week, very shortly, get the guidance about how we can have training in a contact environment. This is for elite sports, so they can start to build up. The final stage would then be the guidelines as to whether they can resume behind closed doors. In doing that, we’ve been guided by the health advice. I can update you again today, for the fourth time there were meetings between elite sports and Public Health England to find out how we can do it safely. If we can do it safely, I’d like us to be able to get it up and running towards mid June if that’s possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (40:16);In respect of broadcasting rights, we have to respect the existing rights that the broadcasters have. But I do think we’ve actually got some flexibility because if you look at, on Saturday afternoons, it has been the case that Premier League matches can’t be broadcast on broadcasters. The idea was that people be able to watch them in the stadium, so they didn’t want to compete. Clearly that won’t be possible if we compete behind closed doors. I think that creates an opportunity for us to be able to get some sport, some Premier League free to air. Those discussions are ongoing. I’m having productive discussions, couple of weeks ago. Now I had the latest one with Premier League, the EFL and with the FA. I hope we can sort this out and I also hope then we can get some more money going into the sport of football. I think we could find ourselves in a win-win situation. Stephen?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (41:13);Thank you for the question on antibody testing. So Public Health England have been evaluating the new antibody tests, the commercial tests that are becoming available. And I would have most confidence in that evaluation process because I think that gives it the stamp that we need in order to roll these tests out throughout the NHS. So as those tests are evaluated and they become available, they will be rolled out through health and social care settings. Initially their use will be in those settings and also for surveillance within the community so that we get some information on how many people in the population may have been infected by the virus. So that is where we will start from. I would caution against using any tests that might be made available without…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (42:03);Using any tests that might be made available without knowing quite how good those tests are. So public health thing that as I say is evaluating them for the NHS. I would caution people against being tempted to have those tests."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (42:15);I think one other point to make about the antibody test, the antibody test shows you that you have had the virus. Once you have the virus, the body’s immune system develops antibodies against this and its those antibodies that are detected typically a number of weeks after you’ve had the virus. So it tells you, you’ve had it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (42:33);What we don’t absolutely know at the moment is whether having antibodies and having the antibodies that are tested in those tests means that you won’t get the virus again. We will only know that over time through the science of understanding the type of antibody that’s being produced, but also by following people over time to see that when you develop an antibody and you test positive for an antibody, whether you get the virus again. What I wouldn’t want people to think is just because you test positive for the antibody, that it necessarily means that you can do something different in terms of social distancing or the way you behave, because until we are absolutely sure about the relationship between the positive antibody test and immunity, I think we as scientists would say, “We need to tread cautiously going further forward.” That information will become available over time, but it will take some time to get there."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (43:29);Thank you, Jane, do you have any followup?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Jane Kirby: (43:31);Yeah. If I could just ask a Professor Powis, does he mean by that, that we can hope that everybody in the country will get access to an antibody test by the NHS for free and are other donor discussions going on at the moment for a timeline for that? Would it be end of this year, next year or so on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (43:50);So what I will say is is exactly what I said is that we’re at an early phase of these tests and where we will use them first is in health and probably social care settings for patients, obviously, but also for staff in those settings where it is most important that we understand about the infection."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (44:08);Thank you, Jane. And finally to Mike Brown from Teesside Gazette."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Mike Brown: (44:13);Thank you. Good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (44:14);Afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Mike Brown: (44:16);Middlesbrough has currently, the fourth highest infection rates for coronavirus in the country by population. It has the highest mortality rate in the Northeast and council leaders believe that its current R rate is around 0.85. People in Middlesbrough can’t sit on a park bench in their local park because our mayor believes that the risk from coronavirus is still too high."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Mike Brown: (44:37);I have two questions. Firstly, for the secretary of staff, previously, local micro lockdowns have been discussed to tackle areas where there’s a significant spike in new cases. Can you tell me what specific work the government has done to prepare vulnerable and hard hit areas like Middlesbrough for a future significant spike in cases once lockdown measures are eased and how do you expect local authorities and public health teams to be able to enforce those?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Mike Brown: (45:08);Secondly, for Professor Powis, one council on Teesside has already said it will not reopen schools on June the first due to our higher than average rate of infection in the Northeast. Does the UK’s one-size-fits-all policy for reopening schools on June the first, will that work in places like Middlesbrough and the rest of the Teesside and how confident is the government that our already high R rate won’t go back over one once schools are reopened?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (45:42);Well, thank you and thank you for your question as the Secretary of State responsible for media. It’s great to hear the Teesside Gazette asking a question at the press conference."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (45:51);First of all, you asked about how we would protect the most vulnerable. I’m under no illusions and the government is under no illusions about the challenges for the economy of the necessary measures we’ve had to take to protect the NHS and save lives in terms of the measures that we have taken. They’ve been very tough on the economy, social distancing, and so on. That’s why the Chancellor has announced an unprecedented package of measures to support people through these hard times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (46:24);For example, the job retention scheme, meaning that literally millions of people who would otherwise have been made redundant have been able to keep their jobs. That’s millions of families that still have earners in their households. We are working hard through all of that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (46:40);On the point about local authorities and enforcing and the point about schools, I really hope that as we go through this, we can do so in a constructive spirit whereby we can move together as a whole country and get children back to school for the reasons that I set out. I do genuinely understand. I really understand the concerns of teachers. I understand the concerns of parents about whether this is safe to do so. That is why we’re working so closely with them. But I think the way to do this is to do so in a constructive spirit of engagement."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (47:17);I think on your final point about or maybe your second one in individual outbreaks, that is why we are working so hard on the track and trace. The fact that we’ve made this progress already means that we will be able to, if there’s outbreaks, it’s important to understand what this track and trace means. It means that if we find someone’s been infected by tracing, we can find out who else they have been in contact with and get those people to self-isolate. In that way, control the spread of the virus. I think that’s a very important measure, but Stephen?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (47:48);Yeah, so thank you for the question. I think the first point is of course on the R number. As long as it is below one, it means that the amount of infection in the community is reducing. It’s simply that the lower it is, the faster that it is reducing and the nearer it is to one, the slower it is reducing, but it is still reducing. As long as it is below one over time, we will see reductions in the number of infection in the community. I think that’s a really important point to make."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (48:17);Secondly, as I’ve said before, it’s usual in infections in an epidemic to see variation by geography. So for instance, in the flu season that we have every winter, we see an increase in the number of flu cases. It’s very typical to see that flu picks up and falls in different parts of the country at different times during the winter. That is a very sort of natural pattern to an infectious disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (48:42);Clearly, it’s important that we have national measures in terms of our lockdown measures and social distancing. I think that is the best way overall to approach this. But as we get to a point where we are talking about individual outbreaks, then there will be a need for interventions around those outbreaks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Stephen Powis: (49:04);In fact, that’s no different from the public health response that occurs for any outbreak of an infectious disease. A set of measures will be taken by public health colleagues, either in local councils or with public health England to ensure that a particular outbreak in a particular area is taken under control. I think that is a well tried and tested public health policy. Contact tracing is part of that well, tried and tested public health policy. I think as we move forward in the months ahead, that is the approach around outbreaks, specific outbreaks in defined communities that my public health colleagues will increasingly be using."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (49:46);Thank you, Mike, any follow ups?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Mike Brown: (49:48);Yeah, please. Secretary of State, you’ve mentioned the package that has been brought forward already to support local authorities through the pandemic. Once we’re through the other side of this, does the government need to make towns like Middlesbrough and other disadvantaged areas in the Northeast a priority so that we’re not as hard hit as we have been in the last 10 years of public spending cut? A link between deprivation and our mortality rates in coronavirus has already been established by the ONS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (50:27);Yes, it’s a good question. I know that the Prime Minister is passionate about this. This is why we are committing a record investment, whether that is leveling up the funding for schools so that areas of the country have in past been less well-funded for their schools compared to say, London. We’re increasing their funding. That’s why we’re investing in transport infrastructure, the road and the rails."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (50:49);Indeed in my own area, I’m passionate about making sure that outside of London and the Southeast, people get the same opportunity for cultural experiences and we invest in cultural experiences in a way that perhaps in the past, we’ve focused too much on London. That’s very much an important part of the work we’re doing. Thank you for your question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Oliver Dowden: (51:08);Thank you for everyone that now concludes the press conference."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Speaker 1: (51:13);Indeed that is the end of today’s daily Downing Street press briefing from the government led today by the culture secretary Oliver Dowden."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-20","Speaker 1: (51:21);Let’s take a look now at the key developments. He began by saying that over 177,000 coronavirus tests were carried out in the UK in the past 24 hours. That is the biggest daily total to date. This doesn’t, however, correspond to the number of people actually tested as some individuals are tested more than once."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (12:19);Good afternoon. And welcome to the Deni Downing Street Coronavirus briefing. I’m joined by Professor Chris Witty, the chief medical officer, and John Newton. Before I turned to the latest coronavirus data, I wanted to say something this mental health awareness week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (12:37);I know how difficult the change and the uncertainty generated by this awful virus has been for many people. So many moments of joy have been put on hold, cherished milestones and important events and time with loved ones and things that were in the diary that you might’ve been looking forward to, but can’t any longer take place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (13:02);So I want to say this to anyone who’s finding it hard. These are tough times. It is okay to be not okay. And it is normal to feel low and anxious and unhappy sometimes. But it is so important that if you think you need it, please seek help. If you want to talk to someone, please go to the NHS. It is there for you. And if you’re a health or care worker, there’s a bespoke series of support. So we can care for you just as you care for the rest of us."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (13:41);Just text Frontline, to 85258. Mental health charities are also offering some brilliant support. Today, I’m providing a further 4.2 million pounds so organizations like the Samaritans and Young Minds and Mental Health UK can keep doing what they do best. Everyone can strengthen their mental health just in the same way that we keep our eye on our physical health, including when we’re healthy. And the PHE’s Every Mind Matters Campaign is something that every single person can engage with and use to strengthen your mental health and wellbeing in good times and in bad. So let’s all come together this mental health awareness week and support each other. Turning to the daily figures, we’ve now completed over 3 million tests for coronavirus. In total, 3,090,566 tests have been carried out in the UK, including 128,340 tests yesterday. 250,908 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 2,615 cases since yesterday. 9,543 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. That is a 14% fall from the same time last week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (15:14);Sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus across all settings, 36,042 have now died. And that’s an increase of 338 fatalities since yesterday. This is a deadly virus and it’s brought pain to so many, both here and across the world, but we are making some real progress. And I’d like to take a moment to remind everyone about our plan to defeat coronavirus and get Britain moving once again."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (15:47);Slide one, please. As you may have seen in previous briefings, we’ve now put in place our COVID alert level system. It consists of five levels based on the R value and the number of new cases. This alert level guides the social distancing rules, which have proved to be so effective-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (16:03);… guides the social distancing rules, which have proved to be so effective at getting the virus under control. The higher, the alert level, the stricter the rules. Now through out the lockdown, we’ve been at level four. As you can see, level four means that coronavirus is in general circulation and that transmission is either high or exponentially rising. But thanks to your shared sacrifice, we’ve now brought R down and because of this caution, we’re in a position to start moving to level three. Next slide, please. Here is how we can move forward. We’ve set out three steps that we plan to take carefully to modify the social distancing rules and start to restore freedom in this country. All the while avoiding a disastrous second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. At each step, we will closely monitor the impact on R, on the number of new infections and on all available data."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (16:58);We’re currently at step one, which means that if you work, but you can’t work from home, you should speak to your employer about going back in. You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like, and you can meet one other person from outside of your household in an outdoor public place, but you should stay two meters apart. We’ll move to step two on the 1st of June, if we are able to do so. Step two involves reopening more things like schools and some retail and using our test and trace system to keep R down. We’ll only move to step two and then in due course to step three, when it is safe to do so. Next slide, please. It’s important that we stay alert and think about what we can all do to control the spread of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (17:56);This means of course, staying at home as much as is possible and working from home, if you can. It means hygiene, washing your hands and cleaning surfaces remains absolutely crucial. Distance, staying two meters apart, wherever possible. Protection, wearing face coverings on public transport and in shops and self isolating altogether, if you have symptoms. And as we approach a bank holiday weekend, we must all renew our efforts over the course of this pandemic people all across the UK have been making difficult, but vital sacrifices for the greater good. So let’s not go back to square one. We can all play our part in the national effort to get R down and keep R down and control the virus. So we restore more of the things that make life worth living. As we follow our plan, our testing regime will be our guiding star. It’s the information that helps us to search out and defeat this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (18:58);Over the past few months, we’ve built a critical national infrastructure for testing on a massive scale. We’ve already put in place the building blocks. We develop the test. We built the test centers and the lab capacity. We created the home testing kits that all this gives us clarity and certainty. We hit the 100,000 tests on time, when we said we would. But we’re always striving to go further to expand our testing capacity and to improve our understanding of this virus. There are two developments that I wanted to share with you today. The first is around swab tests. These are the tests that tell you if you currently have coronavirus. As I announced on Monday, anybody over five who has symptoms is now eligible for a test and getting a test is important, but getting a quick result is important too."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (19:53);We’re working hard on innovative developments and I wanted to bring you up to speed with this. Now it’s really important to be clear about this. Working with innovative science always has its risks, like all R and D lots of projects don’t come off. And just like for instance, vaccines, where we don’t know if we’ll ever get one. But I’m prepared to back innovative developments, even if they might never happen. I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth it, especially in these circumstances to back things before, you know for sure if they’re going to work and I make no apologies for that. We’re working with many top names to help us deliver testing with a rapid turnaround names like Oxford Nanopore and Chronomics and DNANudge. For example, one innovative company OptiGene has produced an early test, which is by being trialed from today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (20:50);It is interesting to us because it is so fast. It doesn’t need to be sent to a lab to be processed. So you get the result on the spot, typically, within around 20 minutes. It’s already proven effective in early trials and we want to find out if it will be effective on a larger scale. We want to support companies like OptiGene and others to develop these sorts of innovative projects. We’ll monitor its effectiveness very closely and if it works, we’ll roll it out as soon as we can. Now, this is just one of a number of innovative testing technologies that we’re pushing forward as fast as the science allows. I will leave no stone unturned and I want to thank everybody involved for their dedication. The second development I wanted to share today is around antibody tests. These tell you if you have had the virus and have developed antibodies in response that might help you to fight the virus in future. COVID-19 is a new virus, and we’re learning more about it every single day."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (21:54);I want to be Frank with you about what we don’t know as well as what we do know. We’re not yet in a position to say that those who test positive in these antibody tests are immune from coronavirus. But as our understanding of the disease improves, the insight these antibody tests provide will be crucial. They can help us to understand how our bodies react to coronavirus and how it’s spread across the country. We’re backing efforts to develop our own homegrown antibody tests through our UK rapid test consortium and that work is showing some early promise. And as you know, we’ve been looking at a whole series of commercial antibody tests. Now, many of these early tests were not reliable enough for clinical use, but we have made some available at small scale. We now have the results of our antibody surveillance study. This has told us that around 17% of people in London and around 5% or higher in the rest of the country have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (23:09);This was based on a sample, but for the public at large, to know whether or not they’ve had coronavirus, we need antibody tests at larger scale. Two lab based products produced by Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Labs have been given a positive evaluation by PHG and approved by the MHRA. Three further tests are being assessed right now. I can announce today that we have signed contracts to supply in the coming months, over 10 million tests from Roche and Abbott. From next week, we’ll begin rolling these out in a phased way. At first to health and care staff, patients and residents. The UK government has arranged supplies of these tests on behalf of the devolved administrations and each devolved nation is deciding how to use its test allocation and how testing will be prioritized and managed locally. This is an important milestone and it represents further progress in our national testing program."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (24:12);It’s not just about the clinical advances that these tasks can bring, although obviously that’s important. It’s that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future. If you are at lower risk of catching Coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus, and of transmitting coronavirus. We’re developing this critical science to know the impact of a positive antibody test and to develop the systems of certification, to ensure people who have positive antibodies can be given assurance about what they can safely do. History has shown that understanding an enemy is fundamental to defeating it. And in this latest fight, our ingenuity and our brilliant scientists and our scientific curiosity are what will keep us one step ahead of this virus. We all have something to bring though in this fight against our common foe. One action that each and every one of us can take is to follow the rules on hygiene, on social distancing, not just for you, but for your loved ones and for your community. So please stay alert, control the virus, and save lives. I’m now going to pass to Chris Whitty to take us through the data charts."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (25:35);Oh, thank you very much sec of state. So this is the first slide to show you is a new slide with new data that came out today from the Office for National Statistics, ONS and other partners. They’ve been doing a random swabbing system around the country to estimate how many people have got infection. And over time, this also allow us to work out how many people are newly getting infections. Now these are central estimates, and I want to be clear that there are a wide confidence intervals around them. But based on these data, they estimate that about 137,000 people in England have COVID at this point in time. This point in time being between the 4th of May and the 17th May so is slightly old data. That this is around about a quarter of 1% of the general population."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (26:34);They also estimate again with wide constant intervals that every week at that stage, around 60,000 people were newly being infected with the virus, so around about 10,000 a day. As the R is still below one, we expect these numbers to go down and to continue to go down. Next slide, please. Starting off with what all of us are doing. There’s clear evidence, firstly, that almost everybody is sticking to the social distancing guidelines and staying at home and traveling much less than they normally would. But there is some increase in activity in terms of the people driving and heavy goods vehicles and light goods vehicles, which are compatible with people, making a very cautious return to work where that is considered to be safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (27:29);But as you can see on the lower graph here, line of the graphs that the national rail transport for London and buses really have remained where we were, very few people using them except for absolutely essential purposes. Next slide, please. The secretary of state has already talked about testing. Here’s a graph showing on the top of the row of this, the testing rates, this is a combination of tests done and sent out. And then below that the number of confirmed cases remember, of course that the number of tests has gone up. So the denominator is changing over time, but they are very gradually drifting down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (28:13);Next slide please. But important data, I think here from hospitals. Now the key thing here is not the absolute numbers, but the fact is the trend lines, which are measured the same way over time. And what you can see is overall, you can see the estimated new daily admissions with COVID-19 peaked in early April and has been steadily decreasing ever since. The same is true for those who are unfortunate enough to have severe disease and have to have mechanical ventilation and the proportion of the mechanically ventilated beds. These are beds where people are having to be supported in intensive or critical care units in all of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are steadily decreasing over time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (29:05);Next slide please. And looking at people with COVID who were in hospital, as you can see, the pattern varies slightly around the country and the four nations, but in all of them, the trend is downwards. Next slide, please. If you look now, this is a slide which has been shown for some time. There was a slight variation, we showed it again. The key thing is not the absolute numbers. The key thing is the shape. The secretary of state has laid out the numbers on the left, but as you can see the trend line for people who have sadly died with confirmed tests for COVID in hospitals and social care settings is steadily decreasing and this trend continues."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (29:55);Now I’ve added on two extra slides at the end, both of these from ONS, the Office for National Statistics. I’ve said several times in some of these briefings that the most important metric for mortality is all cause mortality, which is if all the people who’ve died of whatever cause. The reason for that is that it captures not only people who are diagnosed with COVID, but also potentially people who might have indirectly died as a result of this epidemic. And here what you have is the whole of the year. And as you can see, there was a very significant… The dotted line shows the average number of deaths for this time of year over the last five years. And what you can see is there was a significant peak of this, which coincided with the peak in COVID deaths. But the all cause mortality has come down at the same time as the COVID deaths have come down and is now at roughly the rate it is at in an average winter. So we essentially are having a winter in health terms in terms of mortality, but in late spring and early summer. This is likely to have a gradual tail off over time. We’re not expecting this suddenly to return to the baseline. Finally, I want just to show the shape of the number of excess deaths. Again, these are all causes of death. These are the number of deaths in excess of what you’d expect at this time of year compared to previous years. On the left, what we have is hospitals, acute and community hospitals. And as you can see, there was a significant peak in excess all cause mortality in early April. And that has come right down now till it’s very close to baseline in the last week it was looked at. It was a bank holiday week so we need to be a little bit careful of over-interpreting that for the very last week. And if you look at care homes, the other thing which people are rightly very concerned about…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (32:03);… the other thing, which people are rightly very concerned about. Again, the care home deaths have peaked and have come down a long way. But that peak was slightly later, it was one to two weeks after the peak in hospitals. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (32:17);Thanks very much indeed, Chris. We’re going to first go to questions from the public and then from the media. So if we go to Moish in Coventry, who’s coming to us on video."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Moish: (32:31);With the coronavirus death rate being relatively high, will you be advising the Muslim community to stay at home or stay alert during the upcoming three-day celebration of Eid? If not, what is your advice for them? As a member, I am concerned that some people may be finding ways to flaunt the rules, like having garden parties or gatherings."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (32:53);Well, thank you, Moish. I want to firstly, say how much we appreciate all those who through Ramadan have followed the social distancing rules. The clear evidence is that the Muslim community in the UK and indeed across the world have done so much in order to respect what’s needed with the social distancing role. So I want to say, thank you. I know that Eid is coming up and I appreciate that many people won’t be able to celebrate in the normal way, because of social distancing. And it’s normally a time when people come together. So I hope that people can enjoy Eid celebrations, but I know that there’ll be different from usual. So Moish, I want to say Eid Mubarak, and I want to pass over to professor Whitty to give you the clinical advice, very specifically, that you asked for."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (33:52);So the clear answer for all faiths is people will have to adapt the celebrations, the joyful celebrations around the current social distancing rules. And everybody knows what those rules are, and they remain the same for every community. And the reason we must all do that is this is to protect the whole community, all communities. And all of us must find ways around this, of whatever faith. But I know that all Muslim colleagues and friends of mine are adapting, as every other faith has adapted over this period, their celebrations. To make sure they can maintain both the celebration, but also maintain the social distancing, which is absolutely critical to keeping the R below one and the transmission rates going down across the whole of the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (34:46);Thanks very much. The next question is from Finley. Finley asks, “If a vaccine is developed, will it be mandatory? And if not, how will you bridge the difference of opinion between those who believe it necessary and those who do not?” Well Finley, the first point to make is that we’re doing everything we can to get a vaccine. And we will only recommend a vaccine if it is safe. And that means that if we get a vaccine, and I very much hope that we will, and we’re working incredibly hard for that, and people are asked to vaccinate, to take that vaccine, then they absolutely should because we’ll only do it on the basis of clinical advice that it’s safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (35:31);The question of whether it’s mandatory is not one that we’ve addressed yet. We’re still some time off of a vaccine being available. But I would hope given the scale of this crisis and given the overwhelming need for us to get through this and to get the country back on its feet, and the very positive impact that a vaccine would have, that everybody would have the vaccine."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (35:59);Can I add an additional point on that? Which is essentially a technical point. If you think about vaccines, there are a lot of different sorts of vaccines, but you can broadly use them in two ways. The first way, which everybody thinks about, is as an epidemic modifying vaccine. This is you give it to the whole community, rather like MMR. And that protects everybody from getting these infections. But the other way you can use a vaccine is that you can use it as a disease modifying vaccine. You give the vaccine to those people who are most at risk. And you might do this because there isn’t enough vaccine. So you’d want to protect the people who are most vulnerable, or you might do it because there’s a partially effective vaccine that can stop people dying, but it’s not enough to stop the transmission of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (36:45);And in that case, you would give it to a much smaller number of people. Now, clearly in that second group, you are absolutely doing it only to protect the person who is being vaccinated. And if they choose not to have that protection, it doesn’t affect anybody else. That is simply their choice. But then they obviously are denying themselves the protection that this kind of vaccine could provide."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (37:08);Thanks very much, Chris, John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (37:10);Well, Secretary of State, just a more general observation about vaccine programs. The most successful vaccine programs tend to be by consent. So what really matters is clear explanation of the benefits and risks, any risks that are associated with the vaccine, and a really good system to make the vaccine available to everybody who needs it. So although some countries have adopted mandatory programs, the most successful programs tend to be done on the basis of consent, good information and good delivery mechanisms. But, clearly mandation is there. Can be used in some instances."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (37:41);Thanks very much, professor Newton. We’ll now go to Laura Kuenssberg of the BBC. Laura."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Kuenssberg: (37:47);Thank you very much, Secretary of State. Did the Prime Minister change his mind on making health and care workers from overseas paid towards the NHS or was he just worried about losing a vote? And can I ask you also on social care, can you confirm that you were planning to introduce a cap on care costs in England? And do you accept this crisis has shown that reform of the system cannot be put off again?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (38:09);Thanks, Laura. The Prime Minister has asked the Home Secretary and I to work on how we can remove NHS and care workers from the NHS surcharge as soon as possible. And I’m very pleased to be able to do that. I’ve already spoken to the Home Secretary and we’ll be saying more on how we do this in the next few days. The Prime Minister has clearly, himself, been a beneficiary of carers from abroad. And we’ve talked many times during this crisis about the enormous contribution that people from overseas make to the NHS and to social care. So the purpose of the immigration health surcharge within the NHS is a fair one. And the purpose is to ensure that everybody contributes to the NHS. But also those who work within the NHS and within the social care, are themselves making that contribution directly. So the Prime Minister has made that decision and he’s asked us to make it happen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (39:17);On social care more broadly, as you know, we put in the manifesto on which we were elected, the need to reform social care. I would say that the crisis has demonstrated the need to bring health and social care closer together. Colleagues in social care, worked so closely, and are working so closely with the NHS. Much more closely in this crisis than I’ve ever seen before. Yet, there are organizational and bureaucratic boundaries that hold them apart. And so I can confirm that we’re working as we set out in the manifesto on making sure that social care is as strong and sustainable as it possibly can be in the future, so that we have a sustainable system that gives people the dignity that they crave as they grow old and for adults of working age."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Kuenssberg: (40:16);Can I come back on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (40:16);Yes, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Kuenssberg: (40:18);Can you tell us when that plan will emerge? And can you confirm that that would include a cap on care costs for individuals sometimes who end up having to sell their homes in order to pay?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (40:27);Well, we have been clear on that second point. Absolutely, that people shouldn’t have to sell their homes to pay for their care. That principle’s very clearly set out in the manifesto. And it’s something that I think is very important. And I’ve seen the injustice of… It’s impossible to know in advance whether, especially in older age, whether you’re going to need care or not. And there is no system of insurance for people to be able to do anything about those costs. So I’ve seen the injustice of that. We’ve set out that we will address that as part of the reforms in the manifesto. And I’d love to give you an update on timing, but we have got all the urgent work on coronavirus to deal with at the same time. And so I’m not able to give you any firm commitments on timing I’m afraid."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Kuenssberg: (41:16);Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (41:16);Thanks very much. Dan Hewitt from ITV. Dan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Dan Hewitt: (41:22);Good afternoon, Health Secretary. Research from the Food Foundation shared with us, showed the number of households struggling to get access to enough food, or skipping, or rationing meals, has doubled since the start of this crisis. That includes 1.7 million children. Given we don’t know when this crisis will end, does the government have a longterm plan beyond what it’s already done to help millions of struggling families? And secondly, if I may. Yesterday, the Prime Minister insisted it was the right thing to do to charge migrant health workers who used the NHS. Now he says, it’s the wrong thing to do? What exactly happened in the last 24 hours to make him change his mind?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (41:58);Well, the Prime Minister yesterday gave an answer about the immigration health surcharge as a whole. And has asked the Home Secretary and I to work on making sure that NHS and care workers don’t have to pay it. So, that’s the explanation to the second part of your question. On the first part, you’re absolutely right to ask about this. It’s incredibly important. It’s something that we worry about. Making sure that people get access to the basics, no matter what their circumstance is. We’ve introduced the program for those who are being shielded, because they’re clinically vulnerable. 2.2 million people who have the offer of support. And we’ve delivered over a million food parcels to those who need them. Who, when they’re contacted by the NHS are asked, all of those 2.2 million are asked, “Do you need help, for instance, with food?” And we’ve been able to give them that support. And also connected them to supermarkets."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (42:58);And I want to pay tribute to the supermarkets, who’ve done incredible work for the shielded. But there’s also a group of non-shielded people who are vulnerable. And in some circumstances, they might not be clinically more vulnerable, but they are vulnerable. And this is one of the many impacts. One of the many bad things about this virus is it can be harder for some vulnerable people to deal with the consequences of the virus, like all the social distancing. And so we have a program in place to support them as well. And we’ve put significant amounts of money into the shielding program and local support, coordinated locally by councils. And it’s an incredibly important part of the support. And I think you’re absolutely rise to raise it, Dan. Thanks very much. Beth Rigby from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Beth Rigby: (43:53);Thank you. Secretary of State, the government’s own COVID-19 recovery strategy states in black and white that an app system needs to be built and successfully integrated for the track and trace system to work. But now the government’s saying the system can function effectively without it. Was your strategy document wrong, or have you moved the goalposts? And if I may to professor Newton, Oxford scientists who are advising the government on the contact tracing app, say test results need to come back within 24 hours to stop the spread of the virus. I know you’ve just announced this new swab trial, but how long do tests take at the moment?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (44:38);Thanks, Beth. So on the first one of those, we’re absolutely clear that the test and trace system needs to be in place, and that is on track for delivery by the 1st of June. And as you know, we’ve been hiring the contact tracers, and we’ve hit the deadlines for those. And they are in place. 24,000, as of yesterday. And we have got the testing capacity. And the technology is an important part, but it is not the only part. And in fact, one of the lessons from the Isle of Wight is that getting the human contact tracing in, so that people understand the consequences of if you have been in close contact with somebody who tests positive, and somebody calls you and asks you to… Therefore, says that you have to self isolate."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (45:35);It is important that that is done properly. The app is, as you know, working in the Isle of Wight. We want to make sure that this whole system lands well and supports the ability safely to make changes to social distancing rules. And the system will, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, we have high confidence that the system will be in place by the 1st of June. And then it will grow stronger and stronger. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (46:03);Thank you, Secretary of State. Yes, it’s a good question. It’s important to understand that the test and trace program has more than one component. And core to this is the public health contract tracing, which is used internationally. It’s recommended by WHO. It’s public health good practice. We used it in the containment phase. So somebody who tests positive is contacted and asked firstly to self isolate themselves and for their household to self isolate. And then there’ll be asked about their contacts, their close contacts. And those contacts are then contacted, and informed and given advice. That’s a process which is completely independent of the proximity app. Although, it is in fact… It’s augmented with an online information system, which is web based. And this will all become a little bit clearer when we introduce it. But all that work is now in place. And we are ready to go with that system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (47:02);And in fact, it was used, as I say, in the containment phase. And we’ve had a very successful trial of it in the Isle of Wight. In addition to that process, for people in the general public, the app is an additional component, which tells you if your phone has been close to another phone with the app in such a way that you might have been in contact with somebody who have the risk of passing on coronavirus. So that can be led on top of the more personal contact tracing, which is driven by the public health process and the telephone process."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (47:37);So they are distinct, but complimentary. And it’s perfectly okay, in fact, possibly advantageous to introduce the one before the other. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (47:46);Thanks, Beth."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (47:46);And in terms of the, I’m sorry. In terms of the timing of the test. You’re absolutely right that the sooner the tests come back, the sooner people can be alerted about their risk and the more effective the process is. So we’re working very hard to get these turnaround times down. At the moment, 90% of tests come back-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (48:03);… down. At the moment, 90% of tests come back, the results come back within 48 hours of the test being done. And almost half of those are back within 24 hours. So many people will get the result the same day, but we’re introducing various ways of reducing that time to the absolute minimum."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Beth: (48:19);Can I just ask that you accept that you do need to get the test back within 24 hours for the system to work because, obviously, a lot’s riding on this in terms of public confidence?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (48:31);Yes, indeed. There’s no specific cutoff. The sooner you can get the test back the better. But we’ve been in discussion with the modelers at Sage and models have been built based on 80% of the tests coming back within 48 hours. So we know that the effectiveness would be there with pretty much the level of performance we have now, but we would like to get it better. We would like to get the test back even more quickly because we know that it will be more effective if we can do the testing more quickly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Beth: (49:00);Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (49:01);Thanks so much, Beth. Laura Hughes from the FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Hughes: (49:05);Afternoon. Can I ask if we never needed this app to launch a track and trace system, why is it still taken till the 1st of June to launch this army of human traces? Could we not have got them in place earlier while we were ramping up testing capacity? And also ask, how many daily tests do you estimate your new test and trace system is going to need for it to work?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (49:30);Yeah. Well, two very good questions. I’ll ask John Newton to come in on it. The point about the app is the app is working in the Isle of Wight. But rolling an app out, especially one of such significance because if you download the app and you’ve been in close contact with someone, it tells you that you are at higher risk of having caught coronavirus, we want to make sure that rolls out in exactly the right way. And one of the things we’ve learned from the Isle of Wight is making sure the importance of getting that order. And so we’ve chosen to do it in this order. And the reason that for the timings is that it interacts with the changes and move to step two of the lockdown, which is scheduled to happen no earlier than the 1st of June. Whilst we’re all in lockdown, the implications of being told that you yourself need to go into lockdown are smaller as those social restrictions ease. And so that’s the interaction with step two."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (50:37);And the critical point is that, of course, when the number of new cases was much higher, then the ability to do the contact tracing is much more difficult and less effective. But as Professor Whitty has just demonstrated with the new statistics published this morning from the Office of National Statistics, with around 61,000 new cases per week, that is the sort of scale that the contact tracing that we are bringing into place will be able to grapple with. And we’ve always said that the test and trace system will be more effective the lower the number of new cases. And social distancing is bringing down that number of new cases to a point where the test and trace system will be able to hold down. John, I don’t know if you want to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","John Newton: (51:38);Well, Secretary, you put it very well. The time for the test and trace program is a little bit later on as social distancing starts to relax. And of course we haven’t stopped doing contact tracing, the Public Health England still does contact tracing to investigate outbreaks, for example, at the moment. So it’s a question of increasing the scope and the scale at which we do contact tracing in a progressive way. And hiring the staff, the core public health staff who do the more complex contact tracing, are already in place and have been in place throughout, but we’re recruiting additional staff as they’re needed. It clearly wouldn’t have been sensible to recruit 20,000 people and have them not doing anything. At the moment, they’re going through training and making sure that everyone’s ready for when we do need to introduce the new program. So I think it’s all being introduced and in a very measured and effective way. In terms of the numbers, as Professor Whitty pointed out, the ONS estimates there may be something like 10,000 new cases a day. At the moment, we’re seeing around 2,000 positive tests a day. So these are very manageable numbers, and the trajectory is for those to decline at the moment. So those are very manageable numbers for the test and trace program to take on. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (53:03);Thanks very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Hughes: (53:03);If I could just-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (53:04);Yeah, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Hughes: (53:05);I could just followup very quickly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (53:06);Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Laura Hughes: (53:07);[inaudible 00:53:07] risk, though, that as you introduced this new system, you’re also loosening lockdown measures, so people will be going back to school, for example. And you’re not concerned that the number of day infections could start to go up. Is there a point where we see the levels so high that the system stops working because we don’t have the capacity to deal with it anymore? Do you have a figure for that and a threshold under which you might have to roll back this system because it won’t be able to work anymore?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (53:34);Well, we now have I have, through the surveillance testing, a much greater clarity on what the level of R is and a clear goal that R shouldn’t go above one. And that is in place to mitigate against exactly the scenario that you set out. And the goal is to keep the number of new cases coming down whilst lifting measures, the social listening measures as much as is safely possible but with the emphasis on safety. And of course, with a test and trace system in place, that will allow us to do more on the social distancing release safely. So the two need to be seen hand in hand, and it’s all about how do we manage this epidemic down using a more targeted focus on people who are higher risk because they’ve been in contact with someone who’s tested positive rather than the blanket measures that we’ve got in place at the moment. Thanks very much. We now go to Robbie Savage. Robbie."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Robbie Savage: (54:49);Thank you. Thanks for allowing me to ask this question as a Daily Mirror columnist and a grassroots football coach. It is mental health awareness week, and we all know how important all sport is as a contributor to achieving healthy minds and bodies. Why, therefore, is it on published guidelines by governing bodies that junior tennis players, golfers and athletes are able to receive one-on-one coaching sessions but young people who play the working class game of football are currently not allowed to?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (55:20);Thanks, Robbie. Well, it’s good to have you, and thanks for taking part in the press conference. Look, I absolutely get the impact of this virus on people’s lives and their mental health impact. And for many people being able to play football is a huge release and really a positive thing. And the rules are there. Of course, they can go out and exercise, but I know that exercising just with members of your own household or on your own is nothing like being able to play football. So I get it. I understand why it’s a problem. Unfortunately, these rules have to be in place amongst the population as a whole, because we’ve got to get a grip of this virus. And it’s only by following it, the more people follow the rules, the faster we’ll get the number of new cases down and the more we’re going to be able to release social distancing rules. But you don’t just want to have me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Robbie Savage: (56:22);Can I just…?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (56:23);Yeah, of course. Yeah. And then I’ll ask Chris Whitty to come in. Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Robbie Savage: (56:26);So why are some government bodies allowing one-on-one coaching with under 18s whereas the governing body, the FA, aren’t allowing the under 18 game coach one-on-one? Why is it different?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (56:41);Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (56:43);So fully understand the reason for the question. And to absolutely reinforce your point, exercise of all sorts is good for physical health, good for mental health. And that’s one of the reasons we were very keen in the first very tentative easing of some of the lockdown to make it easier for people to do things outdoors. And if it’s within their own family, then a kind of kick around in football… If it were, rather, within the same household, a kick around of football is fine. So a difference, and this is, this is one of the [inaudible 00:57:14] that we need to think about a balance. And I think with all of the things we’re trying to do, it’s about trying to release where we can but not take the risk that we actually start having the transmission again. And we were very confident that it is much safer to do the same thing outdoors than indoors. So that’s the first thing, and that’s part of the reason we were able to do things. But as you know, the rules are, except within your own household, it’s one other person at two meters."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (57:45);Now it’s quite different. And that is a small increment from where we are. Now it is possible to play the kind of sports you’re talking about at two meters with one other person or within your own household. Clearly, to have a kind of league football game, which is a contact sport and does involve a larger number, the risks are greater. Accepting that outdoors is safer that indoors but that a group of 22 people, many of them coming into contact with one another linking their households, is a much bigger risk than to people who are at a two meter distance. At what stage do we think that the rate is low enough for that to be a safe thing to do? That’s the logic for this very, very gradual move because we are very keen, both to try and make it possible, particularly for people to do sport and exercise outdoors for all the reasons you give, but also not in the process of that to link households again and start the process of the R going back up again. So that’s a long answer, but that’s because it’s a very serious question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Robbie Savage: (58:50);So can I have one more question, please, Secretary of State?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (58:51);Yes, you can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Robbie Savage: (58:52);So [inaudible 00:58:53] can you or your scientific colleagues give an indication of the pathway for grassroots football being allowed to restart? Do you think we will have to wait for the vaccine?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (59:03);Well, I very much hope that we won’t have to wait for a vaccine. The first thing I’d say is that some of the projects we’re putting in place, like this test and tracing that we’ve been talking about, are there to try to hold the number of new cases down whilst allowing more social distancing measures to be lifted. And this is one that we can look at and we have a discussion about last time around. And Chris is better placed than me to advise how much of an impact upwards it would have on R and how much further we can go."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Chris Whitty: (59:38);Well, in my expectation and Sir Patrick Vallance’s expectation, this is one of his areas of trade, [inaudible 00:59:45] adviser, is that a vaccine before next year on a widespread basis is very unlikely. So I definitely hope that football will be available possibly with some degree of change of how it’s played. There may have to be some ways you have to think it through in advance of the vaccine. But I think what we’re trying to do is go very, very cautiously along that path that the Secretary of State talked about. But my very strong hope, and I’m sure this is a strong hope of everybody, is football is well before we get right out to the right-hand end of that path because outdoors is safer than indoors. No doubt about it. But mixing large numbers of people in a contact sport is, unfortunately, a higher risk of transmitting this virus inevitably than something which can be played in two or maybe four people at a distance."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (01:00:32);We want grassroots football back as soon as we safely can. Thanks, Robbie. Great to have you on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Robbie Savage: (01:00:39);Thank you. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (01:00:40);Last question is from Ian Swanson from the Edinburgh Evening News. Ian."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Ian Swanson: (01:00:45);Thank you. And I wanted to ask a couple of points about the hospitality and tourism sector, which is a crucial part of Edinburgh’s economy and potentially one of the last to reopen? From August employers will have to contribute to the cost of furlough. Many bars and restaurants say if they’re still closed, that will be impossible. And even when they can open, social distancing might mean that it’s just not viable. So will the government continue pool funding of furlough for this sector, or is there some new support that it could offer? And secondly, many hospitality businesses fail to qualify for the retail hospitality and leisure [inaudible 00:13:26], often just because their city center location pushes them over the threshold of 51,000 rateable value. And is not something that you would also consider reviewing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-21","Matt Hancock: (01:01:40);Well, thank you. The furlough rules have been set in place as one of the most generous schemes in the world. And I’m very pleased that the Chancellor was able to extend them from the deadline this side of summer up to October. Clearly, the details of how it operates is for him and for the Treasury. And I’ll take your comments back. I do understand the importance of it, especially in Edinburgh, which especially during August, traditionally, has always relied on such an enormous influx of visitors for the biggest festival, certainly in the country, if not in the world, with Edinburgh Festival. So I understand the specific concern, and I’ll take that away and talk to the Chancellor about it. That concludes our daily briefing. Thank you very much, indeed, for all of the questions, and hope to see you again soon."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","British officials gave a coronavirus press briefing on May 22. Priti Patel discusses quarantine measures to prevent a second COVID-19 wave."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (00:04);Good afternoon, and welcome to the government’s daily briefing on Coronavirus. I’m pleased to be joined this afternoon by Paul Lincoln, the director general of Border Force, and by Sir Patrick Vallance, our Chief Scientific Advisor. Firstly, I’d like to update you on the latest daily figures. 3,231,921 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 140,497 tests carried out yesterday. 254,195 people have tested positive, and that is an increase of 3,287 cases since yesterday. 9,307 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. That is down 14% from 10,781 this time last week. And sadly, of those tested positive for Coronavirus across all settings, 36,393 people have now died. That is an increase of 351 fatalities since yesterday. All our thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathies remain with all those who have lost their loved ones. At this time of national emergency, it is crucial that we continue remain alert, and save countless more lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (01:34);And that means doing everything in our power to control this terrible disease, taking the right action at the right time to prevent a second deadly wave. And that is why I’m announcing today the next step in our cross-government approach, and these include temporary public health restrictions at the border. And let me explain why we are bringing these forward. As other restrictions, of course, finally started to ease following two hard months of lockdown, the answer as to why we’re bringing these measures in now is simple. It is to protect that hard won progress and prevent a devastating resurgence in a second wave of the virus. We are following the science and introduce him public health measures that are supported by Sage. This will require international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days. That is the incubation period of the virus. So that if people have become infected overseas, we can limit the spread of the virus at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (02:35);And as we are taking this action, we are taking it at a time when it will be the most effective. Passengers’ arrivals have been down by 99% compared to the previous year. Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease. And as a transmission rate across United Kingdom falls, and the number of travelers arriving in the UK begins to increase, imported cases could begin to pose a larger and increased threat. This is because they could become a high proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK, and therefore increase the spread of the disease. So with far fewer people being infected in this country, and with the public having worked so hard to bring our number down, any new arrivals entering the country with the disease during this next phase will have a much bigger impact, potentially causing a second wave."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (03:35);Now, this is of course a different story from when domestic transmission was at its peak, and when overseas travel was such an all time low. Led by the prime minister, the whole government has worked across all government departments, including with the devolved administration to develop these measures. And we do not take these steps nightly. This is extremely challenging, and these are difficult times for the entire nation as our freedoms have been sadly, but necessarily, curtailed. But we do not underestimate how hard these new restrictions will be for people up and down the country, and also those who’ve already sacrificed so much to help beat and drive down the spread of Coronavirus. And I know that families both at home and abroad are desperate to be reunited, but by taking these steps, we could save many more lives by making it possible for more family and more friends to safely be reunited in the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (04:32);We also recognize how hard these changes will be for our travel sector and leisure sectors, who are already struggling through these unprecedented times. So across government, we will continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way. We will review these temporary public health measures every three weeks to ensure that they remain the right ones for our roadmap to recovery. And these measures will be introduced from the 8th of June, so that people arriving in the UK will be required to self-isolate for 14 days except for those on a short list of exemptions. Arrivals will be required to provide contact and address details to help trace them should we need to. And given the amazing public spirit and the level of compliance we have seen so far, we expect the vast majority of people to do the right thing and comply with these new requirements."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (05:31);We know that the vast majority of people will continue to act responsibly to control the spread of this virus and to stop a second wave, but we will not allow a small minority, a reckless minority, endanger us all. So there will be penalties for those who break these mandatory measures. Border Force will be on the frontline of implementing the changes with spot checks as people arrive in the UK. And Paul Lincoln, the director general of Border Force, will shortly speak to us and he’ll provide an update on the steps that people will need to take. And I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank our Border Force staff and our officers for the role that they will play, and for all that they are doing to protect our nation at this deeply challenging time. We are working across all four nations of the UK to make these public health measures work, but are now turned to the enforcement approach that is being taken here in England."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (06:25);We will conduct at spot checks by mid-June to ensure that people are self-isolating. And those some overseas who refuse to comply could be refused entry. Public Health England will set up an assurance service to contact people at random to ensure that they understand the requirements, and to also ensure that they are self-isolating. And our outstanding police will continue to do as they’ve done diligently across the country to engage, explain, and encourage people to follow the rules. We will empower them to use enforcement as a last resort. So anyone breaking their 14-day quarantine could face a penalty of 1000 pounds, and that will be a fixed penalty notice. And ultimately, that could also go into potential prosecution and an unlimited fine for failure to comply with these sanctions. We will keep these penalties under review, and we’ll be unafraid to increase them if that is required."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (07:25);But have no doubt, we are taking these measures at the right time because we’re serious about saving lives and controlling the virus. And we will be guided by the science, and the public health of the public and the country will always come first, which is why we are implementing these restrictions at the border now. Our absolute priority remains to stop the spread of this infection, to save lives, and to stop and prevent a second dangerous wave of this virus. That also means supporting our NHS and making short term sacrifices together to stop coronavirus, taking more lives. I’m now going to hand over to Paul Lincoln from border force who will update us. He’ll provide an operational update, but also talk about the measures and how they will be implemented. Thank you. Paul."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (08:11);Thank you, Home Secretary. Before we consider the health measures of the border, let me start by paying tribute to Border Force officers and staff, saying how proud I am for the professionalism and dedication which has been shown during this pandemic. In some areas, the context of our work has changed. This most prominent area, of course, is in air passenger arrivals. Whereas the home secretary has said, at times, there’ve been down 99% compared with the previous year. But elsewhere, the work has continued relentlessly. So despite the threats and challenges posed by Coronavirus, Border Force staff have been working tirelessly day in, day out in ports and airports, hand in glove with operational partners, such as the national crime agency and counterterrorism policing. And this is to keep the country safe and facilitate the repatriation of UK nationals from abroad. Throughout this crisis, they’ve remained on the front line, and they have needed to. Organized crime groups and those who wish to do the country harm take every opportunity that every crisis provides, and we’re seeing some born to attempts, to exploit vulnerable people as a result of Coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (09:20);So as an organization, we have turned to face the threat. Last month alone, Border Force seized more than 700 kilograms of cocaine and heroin destined for our streets, some of which were concealed inside shipments of face masks. In the last few days alone, we see significant amounts of contraband, including an AK47 assault rifle, ammunition, nearly half a million pounds of illicit cash, and 20 tons of smuggled tobacco. We’ve also intercepted thousands of counterfeit COVID-19 tests, continuing our battle against those who were proliferating from this pandemic. And between the 21st of March and the 15th of May, our officer’s referred 84 consignments of face masks to trading standards as otherwise counterfeit or otherwise below standard. We’re also continuing to work against illegal migration. And in 2019-20, Border Force stopped over 30,000 illegal entry attempts or juxtapose controls overseas."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (10:20);But as well as tackling these criminal threats and working to keep illicit shipments out, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of working to expedite the entry of those items into this country that the country critically needs. Border force has facilitated the importation of medical equipment and PPE for the NHS, for care homes, and the police, as well as 220,000 laptops and tablets, which the department for education are distributing to disadvantaged children to ensure that they can fully access remote education and support. It’s also been important that we could help British citizens to come home. And as part of that, we were supporting the foreign and Commonwealth office with 469 repatriation flights, which brought home nearly 80,000 people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (11:06);Turning to the new measures that the home secretary just announced, however, there are five key points which I want to make. First is that we are ramping up communications to make sure that anyone traveling into the UK is aware of the changes and the self-isolation measures which we put in place. Second, we’ll be asking people to provide their contact details, travel plans, and details of the accommodation where they will be self-isolating using an online form before travel, provided they are not in one of the exempted groups. The exempt two groups are primarily to meet the UK international obligations to provide for continued security of supply into the UK, and not to impede work such as national security or critical infrastructure. The full list will be published shortly on gov.uk, but the list of those not required to self-isolate includes those such as road haulage and freight workers to ensure the supply of goods is not impacted, and medical professionals who are traveling to help with the fight against coronavirus, foreign officials who come to the United Kingdom to work on essential border securities, such as the French police who operate in our controls."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (12:11);And in the recognition of the unique nature of the Common Travel Area, as well as unique position of Northern Ireland, all journeys from within the Common Travel Area will also be exempt. Obtaining people’s contract details on the travel plans for public health England, and for the devolved administrations, will support the test, track, and trace and equivalent devolved administration programs. The more rapidly we can identify and contact those at risk of infection, the more effectively we can reduce the spread of the virus. Third, at the border, there will be spot chats conducted by border force officers. Any obvious errors will trigger a requirement for the passenger to complete another form or potentially be refused entry into the UK. Fourth, passengers will then be required to go to their place of self-isolation. And finally, as the home secretary mentioned, there is the question of enforcement with the potential …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (13:03);… penalties for noncompliance of a hundred pounds for the fixed penalty, for failing to complete the form and a thousand pounds for breaching the terms itself, isolation. And in extreme circumstances, border force officers do reserve the right to refuse entry to any non-British or non-residents who do not follow these regulations. Given the high levels of compliance to date, we expect the vast majority of people will take this seriously and do the right thing. We will however, take enforcement action against a small minority of people who may disregard these actions and therefore further endanger people’s lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (13:41);The advice is quite clear, if you have the virus, or if you’re displaying symptoms, or if you’ve been in contact with somebody with the virus, you should not travel. To do so otherwise it’s potentially putting people’s lives at risks. We recognize, as the Home Secretary has said, that bringing these measures into force, there are sectors, such as the travel industry who may have concerns, and we’ll be working with them on the detailed implementation in the coming days. And we will also keep the measures regularly under review."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (14:11);We all look forward to a time when travel is fully back up and running. And when it is, border force stand ready to provide a warm welcome to the UK. In the meantime, it is essential that we use the levers at our disposal to ensure that the safety of our communities while still facilitating the critical trade into this country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (14:32);Thank you, Paul. Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (14:34);Yes. Can I have the first line, please? I want to start with some numbers. And on the right hand side of this slide is the R, and to remind you that is the number that determines or is driven from the number of individuals infected by one infected person on average. And so uncontrolled, this epidemic has an R of three, means three people on average are infected by one person and the epidemic grows very rapidly. If it’s one, then one person is infected by one person and it’s flat. We’re currently at an R across the UK of between 0.7 and one, below one in every area of the UK, we think, but potentially quite close to one. So the epidemic is either flat or declining at the moment in the UK, and in most areas it’s declining as I will show you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (15:28);As the epidemic becomes smaller, there are two numbers to concentrate on. One is the R and the other is the total number of infections and the number of new infections. On the left hand side of this slide are the numbers that come from the Office for National Statistics Survey, where they’ve been to 14,500 individuals and taken swabs to see who’s infected and also to see over time who becomes infected, and that’s in over 7,000 households. What that study tells us is that in the two weeks from May the 4th to May the 17th, that 0.25%, so roughly two or three out of 1,000 people are infected and have COVID. That comes to a number of about 137,000 across the country. It could be a bigger or [inaudible 00:16:22] or smaller, these have got wide confidence intervals, but that’s the sort of number."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (16:26);The second important number is the number of new infections. So this is people every week who getting a new infection, and here the number looks like about 61,000 people per week at the moment, which turns out to be roughly one in a 1,000 or so people every week are getting an infection."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (16:46);So that’s the sort of order we are. The epidemic is shrinking and the numbers will come down, but these are the numbers we need to keep an eye on because the lower we can get these numbers, the more possible it is to release measures and also to operate the test, trace, and contain system that’s being put in place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (17:05);Next slide, please, just to show you what this means, and I’ve said repeatedly that this slide is difficult because the number of cases tested here and the number of people who are positive isn’t a reflection of the total number I’ve just shown you in the previous slide, the total number. But what you can see in this slide is the number of tests being done per day have gone up a lot in the pink columns. The number of people confirmed as a result of that is going down in the green. And this is from 21st of March where we saw the peak to the top and now it’s coming down. So it’s consistent with the idea, the number of infections in the community are coming down day by day, but quite slowly, for the reasons I’ve said."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (17:47);Next slide, please. As you would expect, the number of people infected is going down. So are the number of people admitted to hospital every day. And here you can see right the way across Wales, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the number of people in hospital coming down and the number of people on mechanical ventilators importantly are coming down. So we’ve got numbers of people on ventilators reducing, the intensive care patients, and the number of admissions, here the graph shown for England, coming down over time each day reducing. This is an important indication that the epidemic is shrinking."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (18:25);Next slide, please. People in-hospital with the disease are also reducing, and here you can clearly see the peak. When you look at these graphs, going from the 20th of March through to the 21st of May, most obvious in London, where you can see a peak occurring around the beginning of April and then coming down now day by day. And you can see it’s a bit flatter in other places. So it’s not decreasing at exactly the same rate across the country, but wherever you look, it is decreasing. There’s clearly some work to be done to make sure it’s decreasing everywhere. And these last few numbers are going to be hard to get down, but we’ve got to keep trying to push them down. The lower the numbers, the better."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (19:07);Next slide, please. And as you would hope and expect that as those numbers come down, infections, people admitted to hospital, people in-hospital, people on ventilator beds, so the number of deaths reduce as well. And this shows the number of deaths from the Department of Health and Social Care … numbers. They’re a little bit higher if you look at the Office for National Statistics numbers because these are only COVID confirmed, and the ONS numbers contain suspected as well. But what you can see here is a clear, again, a peak that occurred with a reduction now in the number of deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (19:42);And I just want to pause here to say this peak is an artificial peak. It’s a peak that we managed to suppress by the things that you have all done, we have all done to adhere to social distancing. The risk is that if we move too fast and do things in the wrong way, we get a second peak that would look exactly the same. And that’s what we’ve got to avoid."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (20:09);Last slide, please. So as a reminder, as some of the rules around this are relaxed, it’s important that we do maintain the social distancing and we do maintain the rules around distance between people and our interactions. And it’s really quite encouraging to see that still we’ve got good information, good knowledge that actually people are adhering to this on the whole, and of course, it’s also the case that people are able to do more because the relaxation of rules and that’s important as well for other health reasons."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (20:44);So everything pointed in the right direction. R between 0.7 and one, numbers coming down, but we need to keep on with it and we need to make sure that we don’t relax at the wrong time and end up with a recurrence and a growth again of this epidemic. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (21:01);Patrick, thanks very much. Thank you. That’s very, very clear. I’m now going to move on to questions. And the first question is from Emma from Wealden."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Emma: (21:12);What guidance and advice do you have for couples who have weddings booked, worth thousands of pounds, in August and September? What number will you put on a small gathering?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (21:22);So for those that didn’t quite hear that question, the question was what guidance and advice do you have for couples who’ve booked weddings. Now I’m going to speak about … I’ve got friends who’ve also booked weddings and had to cancel weddings. I think we all know people who’ve been in exactly the same situation. I think we’ve just heard from Patrick, who’s spoken about making sure that we take the right measures in particular to control the virus, but at the same time now we know that everything that we do in terms of not just working to control the virus, but making sure we take individual responsibility is absolutely crucial."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (21:56);But I think Patrick, perhaps on this point of gatherings, if you would like to just expand further about the best advice, because obviously we’re not encouraging gatherings at all. We do want to make sure that we can get into the position where people can obviously get back to holding weddings and living as normal as we possibly would like them to."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (22:16);Well, the science advice on transmission is obviously related to the number of contacts you have and the closeness of that contact, and the duration of contact. And particularly we’ve been aiming to try and break transmission between households and across households and other areas because that’s what’s kept this under control. So as any decisions are made about relaxing those sorts of guidelines, and one of the things that’s happened is a bit of realization in terms of outdoors, where we know transmission is much less likely, but any decisions to relax would need to be based on a risk based assessment. And so the science can provide some guidance, but it can’t choose the number. That obviously has to be a policy decision in terms of how government would like to take that forward."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (23:01);Thank you, Patrick. Can we have the next question, please. This is from Geovanna from Cambridge, who asks, “When will dentists open and how will patients be safely treated? People are living in pain and delaying even a small problem can become a painful emergency.” Patrick, do you want to …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (23:20);Yes, this is really a health question and not a direct science one, but it is an important one. And it’s clear that some professions are more likely to be close to people for long periods, and you may get some sort of aerosolization of some of the sputum and so on. So there are risks in certain professions, and dentistry is clearly one of those where that might be the case."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (23:45);This is being looked at, I know, by the chief medical officer in terms of what could be done to reduce that. And of course, dentists are healthcare professionals who are used to working in environments where there’s an infection risk. So I know that this is being looked at very carefully, and I know that the CNO and others are thinking about what the guidance should be that would allow this to happen. And I absolutely recognize that this is a key thing that people want to see open for all the reasons that have been put by Geovanna."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (24:15);Thank you, Patrick. Can we now move on to direct questions from the media. First question is from Tom Burridge, BBC. Good afternoon, Tom."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Tom Burridge: (24:25);Good afternoon, Home Secretary. I’ve got one question for you please, on the quarantine, and then another question from a colleague about schools if I may. Home Secretary, now that this measure is coming in, is it fair to assume now that most summer holidays abroad will not happen this year? And the second question is while the risk to children are judged to be relatively low if schools reopen, to what extent might they be more serious for families and for the wider community?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (24:55);Thank you, Tom. Well, I think in answer to your first question, of course the advice is not about booking holidays right now. We’re bringing in these measures for very clear reasons, as I have already outlined this afternoon, and Paul Lincoln, who’s also explained how we’re going to bring those measures in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (25:12);The other point to note as well is of course advice from government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is you’re not to travel and please follow the advice that they are putting on their website, which is nothing but essential travel. So this is absolutely not about booking holidays. We have to be clear about we want to afford a second wave and that is absolutely vital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (25:34);And I think in terms of your second question about schools and safety around children, reopening schools, I think it’s really important to recognize right now, many of our schools are actually open and many of those schools are doing fantastic work, obviously providing schooling for children of key workers, but also equally as important vulnerable children. There are many, many vulnerable children, hundreds of thousands of vulnerable children, who are safer in school in many, many cases."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (26:03);But, of course, you’ve asked the question about infection control and families. And that is, of course, something that has to be looked at very much in a local setting at a localized level, but also following the advice from governments and the scientific advice, the advice that we’ve heard from Patrick and from other colleagues as well. And that is crucial. And of course, the department of education and other colleagues across government are working on this and looking at this right now. Patrick, did you want to add anything to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (26:31);So the question, and you’re quite right to frame it as the risks for children are of this disease are much lower. We know that. They are very low risk, but not zero risk. And there have been some serious cases in children, of course, but very few compared to adults and older age groups. The broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you start to reintroduce any contact, then you put some pressure on the R, and you put pressure on numbers. And that’s true for anything that we’re going to do in terms of changes to contact. The judgment early on was that schools are relatively low part of that risk, although there are other consequentials that happen as a result of opening schools. I mean, in terms of people going to business and other contacts, which can add to that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (27:18);So there are various scenarios that can make risk lower or higher, things like safe environments are important. Things like class size, things like the amount of face-to-face contact. And these are things on which we’ve given science advice, on which policy can then be determined. But it’s worth absolutely reflecting that the overall risk, if you look at it, is not one that you pick out as a high risk area for R. Unlike, for example, the point that was just made around dentistry, for example, where it is. But it’s not zero. I mean, there clearly is a consequence of reintroducing any form of increased contact."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (27:59);Thank you, Tom. I’m now going to move onto Sam Coates from Sky News. Sam, good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sam Coates: (28:05);Secretary of state, two questions about this summer. Now, 12 days ago the governments of France and Britain issued a joint statement, which said, no quarantine measures would apply to travelers coming from France at this stage. Today in what you’ve announced, there’s no exemption from France. Can you tell us what’s changed over the last 12 days? And also today, Downing Street revealed that they’re also looking at easing the measures you’re putting in place today, by looking at averages that seem to be being pushed by transport secretary Grant Chat. Be honest, are you as keen on that as him? And if so, when’s the earliest they could come in? And to Patrick Vallance, sage advice on education actually seems to make pretty depressing reading. If you’re asking the question, when schools are going to be back up and running completely back to the way that they were in January, do you think schools will be fully up and running in September, or should parents start to realize that that’s just not going to happen?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (28:59);Sam, thank you. Well first of all, on France, I can say to you directly and to the country as well, that over the last 12 days, myself and other colleagues in governments, in fact, I speak to my French counterpart frequently on a range of issues. And I’ve also been involved in many of these discussions. The fact of the matter is, is that we have been working closely with the French government and authorities. Both of us have also been involved in finalizing much of these arrangements. There are limited exemptions, and that’s in the list that will be published this afternoon. Which, when it comes to France, involves frontier workers and preserves the critical supply of goods, which is exactly what we have been discussing with our French counterparts 12 days ago, and have continued to do so. We’ll continue to engage closely with our French colleagues."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (29:48);We do that all the time across government, and that is the right thing to do, while also keeping this list and all measures, as I’ve already said in my statement earlier, under review. And you’ve asked again about travel, which I can fully appreciate and understand the nation wants to start getting back to live in a normal life in the best possible way, hoping to look forward to the summer and potentially travel, on holiday. I’ve already said, the fact of the matter is, we’re not advising when it comes to travel, and the foreign office advice is very clear, nothing but essential travel. And when it comes to averages, look, I think we should be absolutely open to all ideas. This is not for today, but this doesn’t mean we should rule this out in the future. And the fact of the matter is, I spoke in my statement in my remarks earlier on about the travel industry, the leisure sector, aviation. We’re at the forefront of a really dynamic aviation sector in our country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (30:44);Aviation is, in fact, the lifeblood when you think about it. Keeping people moving, but keeping goods moving as well. So we will look at all options. And I and the secretary of state for transport will work with sectors and the industry to look at how we can naturally get the sector moving again. But it’s important to emphasize that we have to do this in the right way, in a practical way, in a responsible way, and in a pragmatic way. But also, when the time is right, and I think actually we will now look forward to engaging them to develop a plan as to how we can do that. I think we should be looking to lead the world when it comes to reopen in aviation, but that’s going to take time, Sam. And I think you’ve also heard that from Patrick today. Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (31:24);Well just to build on that, Chris Witty has said, and I completely agree with him, this is not a three month epidemic. This is a longterm thing that we need to deal with that will require some form of social distancing over a longer period until we get some form of treatment or vaccine, or other intervention which allows us to manage it in other ways. So this is a longterm thing. I’m not going to speculate on when decisions will be made by government on schools, that’s for government to decide. But I will say a few words about what the considerations are that are important. The lower we get the numbers of new infections each week, the greater the chance of being able to do things. The more effective systems like test trace and contain are, the more room you have to make other changes. The more we can modify environments to be useful to keep appropriate social distancing, the better things are."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (32:24);So there are a number of ways in which decisions can be made based on good scientific principles that allow you to decide when to do things. And they’re dependent on those scientific principles and the time at which the data tells you that you’ve got the room to do them. And those are the sorts of things that I think will need to be looked at in order to make these decisions. And, of course, it’s really important to remember that within all of that, the basic hygiene things that we’ve talked about that we can sometimes forget, hand-washing, making sure that we don’t forget about that as a route of transmission become an important part of this. So I think those are the considerations. And then it’s obviously important that schools have to get back, for education for young people at some point. And the question is, how you factor those things in, in order to be able to make the decision at the right time in an era where began to have social distancing for some time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (33:16);Sam, thanks very much. I’m now going to move on to Liz Bates from Channel Four. Liz, good afternoon. Liz you’re on mute."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Liz Bates: (33:28);[inaudible 00:00:33:28]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (33:30);Okay, go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Liz Bates: (33:30);Good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (33:30);Good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Liz Bates: (33:32);Yes, I have two questions on the quarantine, if you don’t mind. First of all, if people come into the UK and they don’t have somewhere to quarantine for two weeks, what happens to them? Where do they go? And secondly, if this is a measure that, as she said, is going to save lives, then why is it starting in June? Why are we not starting to save lives immediately?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (33:57);Liz, thank you for your questions. Well, I think first of all, on your last question. As I outlined in the statement, quite clearly, we said very clearly now that as the number of infections within the UK drops we have to now manage the risk of external transmission. So more people are now traveling. Obviously because other countries are bringing in their own measures in terms of opening up their own countries and society. And so this is now about managing the risk of transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere, so that’s really vital. And that’s why we’re bringing the measures in now, we want to reduce the risk of imported cases being introduced to the UK and to prevent and stop a second wave of this dreadful virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (34:38);On your question on quarantine, quarantining and people having somewhere to stay, well I think it’s important to reflect and recognize right now, the number of people traveling to the UK are at an all time low, 99% down compared to this time last year. Paul Lincoln, director general for Border Force has already said in his statement too, that this will come in, I’ve said this on the 8th of June. We are effectively now working to communicate, obviously around the world, but through all the appropriate channels, what the processes are that people will need to do, the steps to complete a locator form, and also to provide data. And to get ready to, if they do want to come to the UK, they need to have that accommodation. That is vital, and that is very clear in terms of the proposal that we are outlining. Paul, [crosstalk 00:35:27] would you like to add to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Paul Lincoln: (35:27);I can build on that if you’d like, home secretary. I mean, there’s the statement itself says that if you are unable to provide your own accommodation, then we will arrange, as government, accommodation for you, which will be at your expense. And we have a service which we can provide in very limited circumstances where people come in and they don’t have accommodation. You’ll be well aware that we already use immigration and other powers. And if people do not have suitable means, and they are not capable of paying for their own way in the country, if they are a foreign national then they are usually removed. So we have these processes in place already. This is a relatively routine thing to be able to take forward."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (36:03);Thank you, Paul. I’m now going to move on to Gordon Rayner from the Telegraph. Gordon, good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Gordon Rayner: (36:10);Good afternoon, secretary of state. Thank you. The government is trying to build a global Britain initiative and attract investment into Britain at the moment to take advantage of Brexit, when we finally fully. Is there not a danger that in imposing this quarantine scheme at a time when the rest of the world is doing the opposite, you’re telling potential investors that Britain’s closed for business? And can I just ask the scientists to explain to people watching this, why we need to put people under house arrest for two weeks effectively, rather than saying to them to be tested perhaps for coronavirus? And could people who have tested positive for antibodies be exempted from the scheme?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (36:51);Gordon, thank you. I’ll start with your first question, which is absolutely a legitimate question. We are, of course, global Britain, and our aspiration as we leave the EU is to be a dynamic player in the world. Obviously more than open for business, but securing our way when it comes to trade and all sorts of investment opportunities going forward. The fact of the matter is I think we have to put this into context right now, as I’ve said already, international travel to the UK has declined dramatically by 99%. There are some very clear exemptions, that list is being published this afternoon. Critical workers, infrastructure workers, key categories are there. These measures will be kept under review. And I really do want to emphasize that, we are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders. And I think that people need to recognize that. What we are seeking to do is we are seeking to control the spread of the virus because we do not want a second wave of this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (37:51);And if I may, if I hand over to Patrick, Gordon, there are some other points here to note as well. This will come in place on the 8th of June, and between now and then we’ll be working with various industries, but also we will continue to work across government with Public Health England, with the Department of Health and Social Care, to look at track and trace, testing. By the time this comes together we would love to have, and of course we want to have, a plethora of tools that can effectively support these measures of quarantining, but also post these measures. Help us to look at how we can, in this measured and responsible way, open society in the long course. So much, much, much longer term, but in the right way, obviously based upon the size, based on driving the R value down of the United Kingdom. But first and foremost, we must prevent a second wave of this disease. And that’s why we’re bringing these measures in from the 8th of June. Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (38:47);Let me answer the testing questions, generally about testing. So the reason that a negative test is not very predictive is if you’ve just caught the disease, you incubate it for a few days-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (39:03);… when you will test negative. You start to test positive, maybe it around five days, sometimes a bit longer, sometimes a bit sooner. You maybe shedding a lot of virus for a couple of days then, and for a few days afterwards. And then, you gradually recover and may not shed. So clearly, it depends on the time at which you caught the infection as to when you should expect a positive test. That means that just testing somebody and saying, “You’re negative,” doesn’t tell you whether somebody is just about to get it in a week’s time. That’s the reason for thinking about testing in that way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (39:48);Your second question about antibody testing, we’re much more positive that people getting infections do mount an antibody response. I think that’s really quite clear now. The vast majority of people do get an antibody response. We know that some of those antibody responses, at least, and maybe all of them, but we don’t know that for sure, but certainly some of them are so-called neutralizing antibodies. In other words, they would expect, you’d expect that to have an effect in terms of viral infection and transmission. What we don’t know is how long that lasts for. We don’t know how effective that is in terms of either preventing transmission or in preventing infection."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Sir Patrick Vallance: (40:32);So, there’s still work to be done, this isn’t just in the UK, this is globally, to understand the significance of a positive antibody test. It’s likely that it confers some degree of protection, but we just don’t know. We don’t know whether it confers your, if you like, immunity against being able to harbor the virus and transmit it. So I think until we’ve got answers to those questions, and there’s work going on now that hopefully will give answers to those questions, I think to start talking about immunity passports and assuming that an antibody positivity gives you complete protection is really very premature."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (41:13);Thanks, Patrick. I’m going to move on now to Harrison Jones from Metro. Harrison, good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Harrison Jones: (41:19);Afternoon, Priti. Thank you. This week, the public have been blamed as huge crowds of people strung to social distance of beauty spots, notably beaches, but was that not actually inevitable given that the governments told people they could travel wherever they like and sunbathes? What’s your message to local authorities? We don’t necessarily have the infrastructure to safely support huge crowds. One more, if I may, yesterday, you described those working in the NHS and social care as heroes. Many of those heroes were born abroad and we clapped them every week, but what a better way of showing off thanks to those foreign key workers saving lives, including the prime ministers, they’re making them eligible for British citizenship."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (42:02);Harrison, thank you. First of all, with regards to your first comment about beauty spots, local authority, public behaviors, well, look, we’re heading into a bank holiday weekend and the weather is good. This is a beautiful time of the year, as we all know, and we all enjoy being outdoors. I think the fact of the matter is the British public have been incredible, absolutely incredible both in terms of their resilience, but also the way in which they have naturally continue to comply with social distancing, with government guidelines, follow the advice, follow the health advice, continued on the hygiene advice as well. That’s been vital as we’ve seen from the graphs that Patrick showed earlier on in terms of moving past the peak and now trying to reduce and control the spread of this virus. I think it’s absolutely vital and important that we continue to do that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (42:52);It is inevitable, but obviously the public will be out and about a lot more. But of course, our message is clear for the public. Yes, enjoy being outdoors. We have encouraged people to go out, but we have put a very clear caveat around that. This is all conditional. You can enjoy being outdoors in the sun, providing you are following the advice and we continue to stop and contain the spread of the infection."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (43:16);The second point about local authorities is, of course, we are seeing this now become a discussion much more about different parts of the country and the localization of behaviors prove so controlling the spread of this disease too. Local authorities have an enormous role to plan. They are. I pay tribute to them in terms of the work that they are doing. They’ve had a great deal of government support also in terms of putting in practical measures, too, to continue to support people in the community and to control the spread of the virus. But, what I would say is obviously we’re going to stick with this okay. We’ve all made big sacrifices. We do not want to go back to where we started before and there is still much more work to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (43:58);In answer to your question, yes, about our NHS heroes and those who are quite frankly working day and night right now to save lives and to continue to do amazing work in the NHS. I’ve said from day one actually, the last time that I was here on this podium, that we keep all our immigration measures under review given these unprecedented times and challenges. I’m also going to say primarily because I did introduce the Immigration and Social Security Bill in the House of Commons this week as well, which is all about bringing in a points-based system. Our immigration system is incredibly complex. I think this crisis has demonstrated that has shown the extent of that complexity too. You’ve mentioned citizenship and changes that we could bring in. That would need legislation going forward, but as I said, we keep everything under review. I’m now going to go over to Rob Merritt from The Independent. Rob, good afternoon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Rob Merritt: (44:54);Good afternoon. Thank you, secretary. In recent days, you’ve made some announcements that are being widely welcomed to include hospital porters and cleaners within the bereavement scheme to waive the immigration surcharge for health and care workers. In each case, the government listened, the government changed its mind. So, will you now do the same to give automatic visa extensions to care workers and low paid NHS staff who are risking their lives at the epicenter of this crisis? Why should doctors and nurses get those automatic extensions but not their colleagues?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (45:26);Rob, thank you for your question. Again, as I’ve just said already, the work that we’re seeing across the NHS is just absolutely incredible. I’ve also just made the point as well that this is difficult in terms of we’ve seen the complexities around immigration. But right across the immigration system, through these unprecedented times and challenges, we are supporting frontline health workers, social care workers. Obviously, we’re finding ways in which we can support other care workers as well across the NHS. Our immigration system is incredibly complex. I’ve said that I’m looking at various schemes. We keep everything under review. In fact, this point was made earlier this year as well with the Law Commission’s own report on immigration rules where our system is complex. I want to simplify some of these rules. I really do. And so, we’re now looking at what changes we can bring in, very much in the same way as was announced yesterday around changes to the immigration health surcharge. I’m working across government with my colleagues, including the Department of Health, to look at what we can do in this particular space."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Priti Patel: (46:31);Thank you, Rob. I’m now going to bring this press conference to a close. But before I do, I want to just pause to remember those who fell victim to something very different actually and people that fell victim to incredibly despicable acts of terrorism on this day. Three years ago on from the Manchester Arena atrocity and seven years after the horrific murder of Lee Rigby, we remember the innocent victims who were so viciously and so brutally struck down. My thoughts and all our thoughts across the nation are with everyone who lost their loved ones and suffered on this incredible difficult day. We will always remember them. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Reporter: (47:28);That was the Home Secretary Priti Patel, bringing today’s daily news briefing to a close with a very somber note of remembrance of victims of a terror attack. Let’s take a quick look now at some of the key details that she outlined during that briefing. Home secretary outlined plans for two-week quarantine, which will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK, from the 8th of June, although this won’t apply to people coming from Ireland, medical staff tackling COVID-19 and also seasonal agricultural workers. People will be expected to travel to their final UK destination by car, where possible, and not use public transport. On arrival, they shouldn’t leave their residence for 14 days and they shouldn’t have people to visit except to provide essential support. They’ll also be encouraged to download the NHS COVID-19 app out the border."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-22","Reporter: (48:22);Priti Patel said the measures are being introduced to try to prevent a second wave of infection, that enforcement will be taken against people who don’t comply with a thousand pound fines. The home secretary also confirmed that a further 351 people are known to have died from the virus in all settings, taking the UK total death toll to 36,393. She announced that a total 140,497 tests were carried out in the UK in the past 24 hours. Now-"

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (00:09);Good afternoon and welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street. I’m joined this afternoon by Professor Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England and Dr. Nikki Kanani, the deputy medical director for NHS England, who has a particular focus on primary care. Today’s data shows that 1,448,010 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out across Great Britain, including 69,463 tests carried out yesterday. 201,101 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 6,111 cases since yesterday. 13,615 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 13,922 yesterday. Sadly, of those hospitalized with the virus, 30,076 have now died. That’s an increase of 649 fatalities since yesterday. Behind those numbers are heartbreaking losses for the loved ones of all those who’ve died. Once again, our thoughts and our prayers are with their friends and their families."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (01:46);Professor Doyle will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus. But first as community secretary, I’d like to take this opportunity to give an update on the work being done locally during the pandemic to keep people safe, to provide support for people’s jobs and their businesses and to prepare for the reopening and the recovery of our local economies. That’s why it’s appropriate that this afternoon we’re joined by regional journalists who are doing so much to keep people informed about how the national effort is being coordinated in our own communities. A free country needs a free press and the national, the regional and the local newspapers of our country are under significant financial pressure. I’d like to echo the words of the culture secretary recently, in encouraging everyone who can to buy a newspaper. As I said before, the battle against coronavirus will be won in every city, in every town and every village across the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (02:59);This is truly a national effort and it’s a national effort taking place at a local level. My department, the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government has played a vital role in bringing people together to tackle the virus. We’ve provided local authorities with over £3.2 billion during this pandemic so that they can continue to support the communities that need it through this most challenging time, and respond to the immediate pressures they are facing due to coronavirus, whilst also protecting and preserving vital public services. At the start of March, I established a task force to support local resilience forums known as LRFs, standing them up at a local level across the country to prepare each and every community for a range of different scenarios. There are 38 LRFs in England which are made up of emergency services, a range of government agencies, health bodies, and local authorities. They’re headed by some of the most senior and experienced local leaders of the emergency services, of councils, the NHS and others, who together are leading their communities through the crisis with the full support of central government."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (04:21);Recognizing the unprecedented challenge that we faced, I took the decision to embed within them some of the finest military planners in the world from our armed forces, and I’m very grateful for their hard work in recent weeks. This combined expertise and leadership is ensuring a comprehensive, coordinated and consistent response across the country. Responding to the urgent need for personal protective equipment to reach the front line of the care sector, we’ve mobilized LRFs to help distribute PPE and thus far they’ve delivered over 67 million items in England alone since early April. Together with local councils, they’re also assisting us in supporting some of the most vulnerable individuals in their communities and to date they’ve helped us to ensure that one million boxes of food and essential supplies have now been delivered to those people identified by the NHS as extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus, the shielded. With more than 290,000 boxes being distributed every week, this has been a huge team effort and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved for the role that they’ve played and will play in the weeks ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (05:49);We’re also working very closely with mayors to make sure that we have a coordinated approach to tackling coronavirus at a local level. The government has been determined to ensure that the vital work of keeping people safe in their homes also continues. So with the support of the mayors of London, of the Liverpool City Region, of Greater Manchester, of Sheffield, of the West Midlands and others, we were able to announce the building safety pledge. These mayors have come together because they have a number of the high rise buildings with highly flammable cladding in their respective regions. The pledge that we agreed sends a very clear message that vital building safety work must continue despite the coronavirus pandemic. We’ve been joined by 25 local authorities, including 18 in London, who’ve also given their fulsome support. As work on many of these critical sites was paused early on, it’s now slowly starting to resume as a result of this initiative. I would urge any building owner or contractor to do so as soon as practical, where it’s safe, to begin work once again."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (07:12);Now, coronavirus will not stop our mission to level up, to unite and to unleash the potential of this country. The prime minister will set out on Sunday our approach to the second phase of this pandemic. As we look ahead to supporting businesses as they’re able to reopen, my department will lead our work on how our local economies can adapt, evolve, recover and grow. I will continue to support mayors and local government leaders who will play a critical role in this work. Every local economy now needs a plan to restart and recover. We will be informing these plans with our own detailed work in areas such as how workplaces, from factories to construction sites to offices, can be adapted, how outdoor spaces, leisure and businesses, from parks to high streets to markets, can be managed and how public transport networks, from the tube to trams to buses, can operate, in each case guided by scientific and medical advice. We want to ensure appropriate and safe social distancing, providing the public with the confidence to return to work and to return to public spaces and public transport knowing that it’s always safe to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (08:43);We’re considering how we can create more room in town centers for pedestrians, how we can make it easier to cycle or walk to work. We’ll work with towns and places whose economies have been hardest hit, intensively as the recovery begins. Our commitment to infrastructure investment remains undimmed. For example, over two thirds of HS2 sites are open. We want infrastructure and construction work to begin again, wherever it’s safe to do so. It’s clear to everyone that the pandemic is putting huge pressure on economies the world over and there’s no denying the challenges that lie ahead in our own country. But we cannot and will not let this pandemic halt our work to improve connectivity, to provide vital social and cultural infrastructure and to boost economic growth across the regions. That is how we’ll begin to rebuild and to recover from this national emergency. We’re working to ensure the right support is available to local businesses. Last week, High Street businesses began to receive the £22 billion package designed to mitigate some of the effects of coronavirus, with grants of up to £25,000 being paid into bank accounts of those businesses. And of course, our 100 towns benefiting from the £3.6 billion Towns Fund will continue to receive our support and we’ll be working at pace with them in the months ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (10:25);Local authorities have now paid out over £8.6 billion in grants to around 700,000 businesses. As local government secretary, I’d like to congratulate those councils who’ve worked extremely hard, sometimes around the clock, to get those grants out to the businesses that desperately need them. I’d like to congratulate Chichester, Ealing and Hyndburn councils who are the three highest performing councils so far in England. Businesses are also receiving discounts of almost £10 billion on their rates bills in response to COVID-19, with the hardest hit by the pandemic, such as shops, cafes, and pubs, paying no business rates whatsoever this financial year. Together with existing reliefs, this means that 1.1 million rate payers are no longer paying business rates this year."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (11:21);This week, the chancellor and I announced an additional 5% uplift, up to £617 million available to local councils to fund small businesses that rent space in shared offices, industrial units and innovation centers as well as market traders B&Bs that pay council tax rather than business rates, and also to support small charities. Local councils will now have more flexibility to make pragmatic decisions to keep those businesses going so they can bounce back once they’re able to do so. Moving forward, our mission is to ensure everything we can is done to help people to get back to work safely, to reunite friends and family, and to reintroduce the things that make life worth living in a safe way, as soon as it’s safe to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (12:15);Finally, on Friday we will be celebrating as a country the 75th anniversary of VE day. My department, like others, had been helping to plan some of the public celebrations, but we know that, sadly, we’ll now need to mark this important occasion from home instead. Cabinet colleagues have been speaking with veterans organized by the Royal British Legion. I had the pleasure early this week of speaking to Lesley, a 98-year-old World War II veteran on the phone. Lesley was full of warmth and wisdom, telling me how he spent VE day in Sienna having fought his way through North Africa and Italy, and how he would be spending Friday more sedately celebrating at home. He said to me that as we rebuilt and we recovered then, he’s certain that we will do so again this year. I’ll now hand over to Dr. Kanani in the first instance, and then to Professor Doyle. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (13:21);Thank you, Secretary of State. I wanted to just reflect on your points about community and thank communities for following government advice at a incredibly difficult time. I’m a GP and before I was a GP I grew up in a community pharmacy and my colleagues have been facing probably the most challenging time they’ve ever had to. Right across the NHS, people are working under significant stress and strain and our communities have helped to look after them and to look out for them through staying at home and following government advice and becoming volunteer responders and looking out for their own communities. I want to thank you for that. It’s really challenging-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (14:03);… isn’t it? I have a family member who sheltering and homeschooling children and it feels difficult. We all want reassurance and we miss the familiarity of the things that we always used to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (14:17);But I wanted to reassure people who are listening and watching today that your primary care services are still there for you. I want to pay tribute to our GP practices and our general practice teams, our dentists, our optometrists, the unsung heroes, the community pharmacists on the high street who have continued to work day after day and make sure that they’re there for you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (14:40);This bank holiday, they’ll be open as well and it might feel a little bit different. You might have more telephone calls or online consultations. You might see somebody dressed in PPE, as I was yesterday in my surgery. But you must know that your NHS is still here for you, so please come and contact us if you need advice or support over the coming weeks and months. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (15:04);Thank you, Nikki. I think we all want to reiterate your comments and the thanks to GPS and everybody working in primary care across the country. I turn over to Yvonne, who’s going to present today’s slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (15:14);Thank you, Secretary of State. So just to remind us all of the five tests for adjusting the lockdown here, we can see that they relate to capacity and to mortality, to death. And also that we are actually controlling the epidemic itself and the transmission of the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (15:33);So looking at the first graph here please, the next slide, we can see again that this is about transport. It’s a regular slide. It shows that overall, transport use is down a good bit, by 50%, but less so for motor vehicles, and that has been slowly increasing over recent weeks. This is up to the 4th of May and it’s for the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (15:55);Could I have the next slide, please? The important message in all that of course is that we must still respect that this virus does transmit and to stay at home and not to interact too much, because people are still very vulnerable to getting this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (16:14);Now we can see here the daily tests and these have increased over time and this is up to the 6th of May. But I will move on, really, to the next slide, which is of interest, which is the new cases. Here we have more new cases and this may be a matter of concern, but of course it’s also a matter of testing more so that we are doing more testing and therefore we will find more cases. This is what we want to do. We want to find the positive cases so that we can break transmission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (16:45);So onto the next one, please. This is about people in hospital. I know of great interest to you listening and the news here is generally very good. You can see where London had its early epidemic and it has declined. The cases in hospital have declined more slowly perhaps, of other regions. We see here where the Northwest has more cases in hospital than London, but overall we have about 13,000 cases, which is a decrease and it’s good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (17:17);Then if we can just look at the most critically ill patients, and this is about critical care beds use throughout the UK. And this is again good news. It’s for the four countries of the UK. And we can see here where we actually have less than a third of critical care beds being occupied by people with the coronavirus. So good news there, it is declining."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (17:40);Then we look at the recorded deaths, less good news here in terms of these are very tragic. It is very, very sad. But the trend is good because it is slowly coming down, and this is a seven day rolling average for the UK. As has been said, we have 649 yesterday and that was a decline, a slow decline."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (18:05);And then, finally, two slides about the international deaths. The first one is just the crude numbers and this, of course, depends on the size of the country. We have over 67,000 deaths in the United States, but, of course, a big country. We can see the UK and the European countries, they’re further down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (18:27);But if we look at the last slide, which is about the rates per million population, then we have taken account of the size of the country, and we can see a different pattern where the UK and European countries are more closely together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (18:43);I want to say that this really is presented just to show you different ways of looking at death. There are many different ways of looking at death. It is far too early to say how this will eventually result, for how countries have fared in this epidemic. We need to give this some time. Most of those who are used to looking at these things would say probably a year, but we thought you would be interested to see. So thank, you Secretary of State."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (19:11);Well, thank you very much, Yvonne. Before we turn to questions from the regional press, we have two from members of the public and the first one is from Edward in Harrogate."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Edward: (19:21);Given the excess in critical care beds across the NHS and Nightingale Hospitals, my question is why has the UK suffered a greater number of deaths when compared to countries such as Italy who had their healthcare systems completely overrun by COVID-19?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (19:39);Well, thank you, Edward, for that question: Why has the UK suffered a higher number of deaths compared to Italy, for example, whose healthcare system was overrun by COVID-19? Well, I think as the prime minister has said on a number of occasions now, it is difficult to make international comparisons with certainty today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (19:58);There will be a time for that and we have already established the way in which we will measure that in due course, which is a measure of excess deaths. But that is a hard calculation to do with accuracy today. Of course we want to learn whatever lessons we can do whilst we’re still responding to the virus, but I think the time for accurate international comparisons will come in the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (20:21);It is more positive, of course, that when we saw those very disturbing scenes earlier in the year in Italy of their very good health service being overwhelmed and were concerned about the potential impact upon the NHS, that we haven’t seen those scenes in the UK. We have had sufficient ICU capacity. We have had sufficient ventilator capacity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (20:43);Of course, we’ve been able to build capacity for example with the Nightingale Hospitals, some of which have not been used at all so far during the course of the virus. And if Yvonne, you want to add more about the international perspective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (20:57);Thank you, Secretary of State. So credit to the NHS for not being overwhelmed. But international comparisons as I have mentioned, countries, Edward, measure in very different ways. They measure this virus number of deaths in different ways and that is absolutely fine so long as that is consistent in each country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (21:19);It makes international comparisons very difficult, though, because we are not comparing like with like. It’s worth continuing to stress this, because over time probably the right measures have been outlined by a number of our experts, including our chief medical officer, which would be excess mortality, excess deaths overall in a period of time and then we will know truly how we have been impacted. But also this is a comparable measure internationally, so we would then be able to understand how we have been impacted internationally as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (21:55);Thank you very much. Well, our second question is from Emma from Swansea. Emma’s question is: Religion is a huge part of life for many in the UK. Seeing sport prioritized in discussions over other parts of life has been hard to see. How will the government protect the rights of religious communities to practice their faith in community as the lockdown is eased?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (22:21);Well, that’s a very important question. Obviously, in any part of our lives, the government has been driven by a desire to protect life and has taken expert medical and scientific opinion. But we’re very aware that this has been a difficult period for different faith groups."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (22:39);You’ve seen, for example, the Jewish community having to hold their Seders at Passover by Zoom and without having their friends and family around them. You then saw the same at Easter, where churches were not able to come together and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Cardinal Nichols and others held their sermons and services over the internet, as in churches across the country. And then at the moment through Ramadan, friends and family not able to come together to break fast in the way that they traditionally would."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (23:11);We know this is very tough and none of us would want these restrictions to continue a day longer than they need to. But it is right that we stick to the medical advice at this time, however much it goes against our traditions and our religious beliefs in order to protect others as well as ourselves."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (23:31);We are in conversation with faith leaders across the country to consider how when the time is right, they will be able to recommence services in churches and mosques and synagogues across the country. But that moment is not now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (23:47);We’re also been working with them on how we can ensure that funerals and other important events in people’s lives are conducted in an appropriate way. My department has issued guidance to enable people to hold funerals in public spaces."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (24:04);For example, like crematoriums with close members of their family around them, because none of us want to see scenes, which we did see unfortunately in a small number of occasions early on in the virus, of funerals being conducted with few if anyone present."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (24:21);That wasn’t right. We’ve issued guidance now so that shouldn’t happen again, and we’re working with faith leaders to see how where appropriate those funerals can be conducted in churches or other settings like that as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (24:34);I don’t know if Yvonne or Nikki, you want to add anything to that from your perspectives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (24:36);Well, I think, as you said, it’s important that we work with our communities. We also know that we’ve seen a difference in how different communities have had COVID-19 infections as well. So there’s a lot that we can do to understand how our communities are responding and making sure that communities have what they need during the coming weeks and months."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (24:58);And Secretary of State, could I just cite my thanks to the various religious leaders that have worked with Public Health England and with the NHS to handle very sensitive issues in a very helpful, proactive way. Understanding how very difficult this is for the communities in terms of handling the host, in terms of group gatherings and then, sadly, in terms of funerals and respectful handling of bodies, we have worked very constructively. And for that, I am very grateful."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (25:35);Absolutely. Thank you. Well, thank you, Emma for that question. Our first question from members of the press comes from Patrick Burns from BBC West Midlands. Good afternoon, Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (25:46);Good afternoon, Secretary of State. I’m sure you don’t need me to remind you that at the beginning of all this, the prime minister pledged to local authority leaders that they would have a key role, the lead role, in bringing their local communities and vulnerable people through all this. “Resources will follow,” he said."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (26:04);Well, six weeks on, it’s beginning to look as though even the extra help that you’ve been talking about just now may not actually be enough. If you think of Birmingham City Council alone, the extra costs they’ve incurred already as a result of this heading north of 260 million pounds and counting and they’re leader in wards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (26:26);There’s the really crucial services like adults’ social care and children’s services may be compromised in the near future if, as he puts it, the government doesn’t match its words with action."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (26:41);Well, thank you. Well, let me be very clear to local council leaders across the country, including in the West Midlands. We will stand behind them, ensure that they have the resources that they need to carry out the absolutely critical functions that they’re playing in our national response to coronavirus. That was the promise that I made to local council leaders, as did the prime minister early in the life of the emergency."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (27:05);We’ve already provided 3.2 billion pounds of additional resources to councils in just the last two months. We’ve provided almost 4 billion pounds of cashflow to councils, precisely so that they shouldn’t have to face the difficult choices that you’ve just described: between responding to the virus in their own communities and continuing to do very important public service functions like refuse collection, for example, looking after vulnerable children in their communities."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (27:36);In the West Midlands, local councils will receive 347 million pounds to deal with the pressures of coronavirus. That comes on top of a very generous settlement at the beginning of the financial year, which also increased their core spending power by over 300 million pounds."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (27:55);If further resources are required to meet the COVID-related costs that we’ve asked councils to bear, then obviously we’ll take that-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (28:03);… into consideration in the future. And I’ve been working very closely with local council leaders and the mayor in the West Midlands, Andy Street, who’s been doing a fantastic job at leading the community forward through a very difficult time. I don’t know there’s anything further you’d like to ask, Patrick, or move on to the next question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (28:24);I just like to really sort of suggest that the key issue here, Secretary of State, is making sure that the extra support gets through to all the authorities who need it. If you take Shropshire as an example, they say the money that they’ve received doesn’t yet cover all the extra costs that they have incurred. And within that area, if you talk to Shrewsbury Town Council, they’ve been saying on the BBC Radio Shropshire that not enough of the money is actually filtering down to the lower tier authorities like them, who, as they point out are, actually closest to the very communities that most need the help."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (28:59);Well, there’s two points there. Firstly, in terms of ensuring that councils get the resources they need, we’re absolutely committed to doing that. Councils are receiving more money so far than they have reported to us as needing to meet the COVID related costs that they’re bearing. They are also, like other organizations across the country, seeing significant reductions in their income because we’re not parking in their car parks and using their leisure centers and so on. And that’s a particular challenge that we’re also focused on. But that’s a separate issue. In the latest 1.6 billion pounds that we provided to councils, we made sure that a significant amount of it did flow to lower tier councils, like district councils for example. And so your average district council in England will now receive, if they haven’t done so already in the coming days, a million pounds or more of additional grant to help them with COVID related expenditure and also to stabilize their finances."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (29:58);And we’ve asked big parish councils, like the ones that you’ve referred to in Shropshire like Shrewsbury or Bridgnorth or Ludlow, to speak with their principal councils, who will be receiving that million pounds or more of funding, and ensure that it flows down to them if they’re also under financial pressure at the moment. And I hope that that will help. Obviously, my department and I are here to speak with those councils and ensure they get through this with us together. Thank you, Patrick. I’ll come to the second question now, which is from James Vincent from BBC Yorkshire. Good afternoon, James."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","James Vincent: (30:33);Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I’m on BBC Look North tonight. We’ve gone out. We’re been speaking to Sarah, who’s a six-year-old from Tadcaster who needs a kidney transplant. Her operation was canceled when the coronavirus crisis hit. What works are the government and the NHS doing to make sure that those people that need vital care, vital operations away from coronavirus, are going to get that as soon as possible? And what’s the NHS and the government doing to make sure that any backlog is worked through in the best possible way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (31:02);Thank you, James. And that’s a very important question, which I’m sure is on the mind of many people across the country. Can I perhaps come to Nikki in the first instance?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (31:08);[crosstalk 00:03:09], thank you for your question, and it’s something that we’re thinking about very actively as you can imagine. I think it was right that over the last few weeks and months, the NHS made a concerted effort to focus on services that were either urgent for an individual or were related to the COVID response. And we absolutely had to do that, so we had to step away from other procedures and routine reviews that we might have otherwise done. But now, and as Simon Stevens wrote last week, we’ve asked the whole system to start to think about how to get back to what we call normal services. And there will be some things that we want to keep. So during the pandemic, actually, services have revolutionized the way that they’ve worked, whether that’s by using digital technology or developing new ways of caring for patients. But in the case of the child that you mentioned, that that child will be prioritized and that operation will be scheduled so that we can get people back on track and that the really important things happen as soon as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (32:11);Very good. Thank you. Do you have a followup question, James?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","James Vincent: (32:13);[crosstalk 00:32:13] to her quick followup on council finances. Are councils in Yorkshire saying that there’s a 200 million pound gap between what you’re providing and what they think they’ll be spending on the coronavirus crisis? On Monday, you told MPs that some of those calculations from councils were highly speculative. Are you suggesting that they’re perhaps getting their sums wrong?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (32:35);No, not at all. We’ve provided, as I said, 3.2 billion pounds to councils already plus 4 billion pounds of cashflow, so it’s a lot of money to be provided in just a two month period to councils. And we think that is sufficient to meet the immediate demands of the crisis. However, as we understand better the length at which locked down measures may have to be in place and the economic disruption that flows as a result of the crisis, which is difficult to judge today, we will work with councils to ensure that they have the funding that is required so they can navigate their way through this difficult period."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (33:13);So my message to councils is continue to do the important work that you’re doing, whether that’s on adult social care, getting rough sleepers off the streets, supporting the vulnerable, getting those business grants out to the community. And we’ll make sure that you have the funding that’s required, and we’ll work with you to better understand, in the weeks and months ahead, the true impact upon your finances of the disruption economically that we’re suffering and of their response to coronavirus. It’s too early to tell in some cases what those costs will be. But we will learn in the weeks and months to come, and we’ll work very closely with councils, including throughout Yorkshire. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (33:53);The next question is from Tom Sheldrick, who is from ITV Tyne Tees. Tom."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Tom Sheldrick: (33:58);Thank you. Good afternoon. Last week our analysis revealed that the Northeast has had a higher number of confirmed coronavirus cases per head than any other parts of England and the gap is continuing to widen. The virus is affecting some of the most deprived areas in our region particularly badly. The regional chair of the British Medical Association, Dr. George Ray, has called for the government to act on health inequalities, which he describes as a point of national shame. So what are you doing now to try to reduce the number of people in the Northeast being infected with coronavirus? And going forward, how will you address longterm issues, which mean that people in our region are less likely to be in good health and at greater risk from viruses like this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (34:42);Thank you, Tom. Well, I’ll ask Yvonne to speak in a moment to the main part of your question. But on the broader issue of emerging data, suggesting the socioeconomic impact upon deaths with the virus, obviously that’s extremely concerning to us. We want to understand all of the contributing factors that make people more vulnerable to the virus, including those and including, for example, some of the ethnic groups like the BAME communities, and their exposure to the virus. We’re working with Public Health England, and on some of those issues, like for example the BAME issue, the chief medical officer’s commissioned specific research so we can better understand the issue and respond to it in due course. But Yvonne, I don’t know if you want to say more in particular about the Northeast and its position in the passage of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (35:33);Yes. Thank you, Secretary of State. So, Tom, there are over 8,000 confirmed positive cases of coronavirus in the Northeast at the moment, and, as you see, some areas of great need, which of course we would have been involved with, both from our national through to local services in the public health system before this epidemic. What we really need to know now, first, is to understand what additional or excess impact this virus has had on those communities and how distributed that might be. So as well as doing work generally on disadvantaged in particular groups in the population, we would like to look at the geographies that have been most impacted by that. And that work is underway, and we will be able to describe that as we go forward over the coming weeks and months."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (36:26);But also, I would want to reassure you that the business as usual work needs to continue in working locally to promote the good health of people and to ensure that we are protecting their health from issues other than COVID because one of the great dangerous here is that people forget that actually there are other harms in the population, some of which may be greater than the virus itself. So our local team’s working with local councils and particularly local public health departments. Directors of public health are very active. We’re in touch every week and sometimes several times a week to understand the dynamics of what is going on and to make sure that the good business as usual, as far as it can, can continue. And just one concern is, of course, that if our services have how to stop, for instance, immunization or smoking cessation that we actually move as soon as we can when it’s safe to reestablish the preventive services as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (37:31);Thank you. Tom, do you have a quick followup to that question, or are you content?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Tom Sheldrick: (37:35);Yes, please. If I can ask you, Secretary of State, are you considering lifting lockdown restrictions later in regions like the Northeast where the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow while it’s perhaps stabilizing elsewhere?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (37:47);Well, the Prime Minister will set out on Sunday our approach to the next phase of the virus. So I don’t think that I can helpfully presage those remarks. Our strong preference, though, is that the whole country moves as one, but if, as we build up our infrastructure for testing and tracking and tracing, in time it’s required for us to make interventions in smaller sort of micro communities where you’re seeing the virus take hold again, then that will be something that we consider as other countries around the world have done when they’ve implemented effective track and trace systems. But that’s quite different to making major changes to lockdown measures in one part of the country versus another and our strong preference, as it was at the beginning of the lockdown measures, is for the whole country to move as one. I’ll go now to the next question, which is from Zena Hawley from the Derby Telegraph. Zena"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (38:48);Thank you, Mr. Jenrick. I wanted to say that Derby is a great city with a strong industrial base, but the announcement of 8,000 potential job losses at Rolls-Royce could have extreme consequences, obviously for the company, but also for the supply chain of the companies that obviously supply it. What can the government do to help Rolls-Royce, a company that’s always been there for Britain through times of extreme hardship, et cetera? And also, could ask more widely what role does the government expect cities like Derby to play as we emerge from the current crisis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (39:24);Well, thank you very much, and I share your concern for the news of potential job losses at Rolls-Royce. I know how important Rolls-Royce is to Derby, to the Midlands and to the whole country. It’s one of our most important advanced manufacturing business, one with a very rich history, and I’m certain a business that will have a great future as well. It’s renowned all over the world. Aviation is an important sector to the economy, but it is a sector facing almost unprecedented issues as a result of coronavirus. We want to support the aviation sector in any way that we can do. The Chancellor has already announced an unprecedented set of measures to support businesses large and small. I know that Rolls-Royce is a business that has already taken advantage, for example, of the Job Retention Scheme, furloughing some of its employees from April."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (40:24);We’re going to work closely with the sector, and we’ve said before that we’re willing to consider situations where we would support individual firms, but obviously only when they’ve worked through the existing government schemes and other ways in which they might be able to raise finance commercially or through existing shareholders. If there’s more we can do for Rolls-Royce, we want to do so, and I know that the Business Secretary and the Chancellor are already in contact with Rolls-Royce and will do so again in the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (40:57);As regards Derby more generally, well, it’s one of our great cities, a city I know well representing a Nottinghamshire constituency nearby. I’m certain it has a strong future. I will be working closely with local leaders to ensure that their plans for rebuilding and recovering the local economy work in step with those that we’re producing nationally and the voice of the business community in Derby is heard in the decisions that we’re making here in Whitehall. And that’s the same for cities, for local government leaders and for mayors across the country. Thank you very much. Was there a further question you’d like to add, or are you content with that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (41:34);If I could, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (41:34);Absolutely."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (41:35);I want to talk about education because that’s something that’s dear to my heart as the education correspondent at the Derby Telegraph. Schools and their plans for reopening. I’ve had discussions with local unions. I’ve had discussions with local experts in the education field. And there is a strong feeling that it’s going to be very, very difficult to achieve very easily, and I’m wondering whether or not there is going to be any move towards having PPE in schools at all?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (42:03);So far, teachers have been going into school, they’ve been there for key workers’ children, they’ve carried on. And I know there’s been quite a bit of illness among teachers, but what can we do to protect our teachers and actually give confidence to parents, staff, and pupils that could be going back to school any time?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (42:24);Thank you. Well, I know that there will be concern from teachers, as [inaudible 00:42:28] parents and the education sector have been working closely with the trade unions and other representatives from education to plan a phased reopening of schools when the time is right. We have taken scientific advice with respect to the level of PPE that might be required in schools, and I’ll let Yvonne speak to that perhaps in a moment, who’s better placed than I will. But as I understand it, the advice is that staff in non-residential education settings don’t require PPE, but we will obviously keep that under close review. And we’ve also published guidance on social distancing within schools, which is already being applied in the schools that are open, obviously only with a small percentage of students currently in them, but which will inform the plans that are emerging for the reopening of schools when the time’s right. And if Yvonne’s, there’s anything you’d like to add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (43:22);So [inaudible 00:01:21], yes. Getting the confidence of parents and teachers will be critical actually, as to whether the children would come back to school even if it was agreed that they should. And what can be done there is part of a package. It’s very important that… You’re probably thinking about PPE like face masks. Now face masks, there’s been a lot of debate about that. They are probably helpful to protect others from yourself when you’re not well, particularly if you’re exuding droplets, coughing and sneezing and so on, but they have to be worn properly. And people always forget that face masks are not actually what is going to contain the virus, wholly. It is a whole package of issues like good hygiene, particularly hand hygiene, how you interact your hand with your face and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (44:13);And equally, how the school environment is kept clean, disinfected, how the children are spaced, and this will all take quite a lot of organization. So, this is why no one is rushing to do this prematurely. And we have looked at what other countries are doing on this so that we’re learning about how countries have gained the confidence of parents and teachers. Teachers are key workers, and if they’re unwell they can have testing, and they should do that and indeed should not work if they’re unwell. So, there is good guidance. We in Public Health England and others are working with the Department for Education intensely on this, and with indeed the trades unions and others in those conversations so that we try to get this right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (45:00);Thank you, very helpful. Welcome to the next question now, which is from Keith Rossiter, and Keith is from Cornwall Live and the Western Morning News. Good afternoon Keith."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Keith Rossiter: (45:11);Good afternoon secretary of state. Well, thanks for encouraging your viewers to go out and buy a copy of the newspaper. Cornwall relies heavily on tourism and the hospitality industry, and our hoteliers, publicans and resorts fear that they could lose a whole year if they don’t reopen by July. If that happens, what will the government do to support them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (45:40);Thank you. Well, I think we all understand that many businesses across the country are suffering, but those in hospitality are particularly poorly equipped to cope with what’s happening at the moment. And an economy such as the Southwest, which is so heavily dependent on tourism, will be very significantly impacted. The package of measures that the chancellor has already brought forward are helping businesses in Cornwall. I think Southwest councils will receive over one and a half billion pounds of business support, and there’s 126,000 businesses within the Southwest who are eligible for those grants."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (46:19);I know that Cornwall council is one of the best in the country for getting those grants out to the businesses who really need them. They’ve already paid out 202 million pounds worth of grants to 17,789 firms, which is one of the highest in England, and I pay tribute to the officers at Cornwall Council for doing that. The prime minister has said today that if further interventions are required to support a sector like tourism or hospitality, we will obviously consider that and bring forward appropriate measures when they’re needed. We know that it’s going to be very difficult for them in the months to come, and we want to try to guide their path through this period so that they, like the rest of the economy, can bounce back when we’re able to reopen in due course. Keith, I don’t know if you have a second question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Keith Rossiter: (47:16);Yes I do. Thank you. Sir Patrick Vallance, earlier in the week, suggested or hinted that some regions could come out of lockdown sooner, and we saw from one of the slides earlier that the Southwest has the lowest number of cases. If we were released sooner, what support would there be for Devon and Cornwall police, who are already very overstretched, to prevent a large scale invasion of holiday makers?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (47:53);Well, I’ll pass it on to Yvonne to speak about the regional disparities in the path of the virus and how we might respond to that, including through tracking and tracing. In terms of local councils and the emergency services and ensuring that they have the support that’s required, as I said earlier, we’re providing additional funding to forces and the home secretary is speaking with national police chiefs to ensure that they have the right guidance and consistent messaging that they can use to enforce the lockdown rules where that’s required. And as we’ve seen so far, the vast majority of members of the public have chosen to do so and to adhere to the messaging. And most police forces have been able to support the lockdown measures through consent, which is the way we want to do things in this country. But in the isolated number of cases where that’s not been possible, obviously they’ve also had tools at their disposal to find and to enforce the lockdown. Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (48:57);So, thank you [inaudible 00:48:58] secretary of state. So Keith, there are over 14,000 confirmed cases in Cornwall. Saying that, it’s a big county, so actually the epidemic seems to have had somewhat less impact in the Southwest, and we need to be absolutely sure that it stays that way. So, we’re watching it very carefully and hopefully it will. Now if and when restrictions ease on the way people are living lives at the moment, it would be very important that we don’t begin to see the reemergence of transmission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (49:37);And what secretary of state has been describing is this major program that we are actually trialing at the moment through the use of an app in the Isle of Wight but will be much broader than that. It will be really a population based program to ensure that people who are unwell, particularly with the symptoms of this virus, are isolated pretty quickly and tested quickly and that their contacts, particularly their immediate contacts, the ones that matter are also informed and can take action. And that will absolutely be key to gradually releasing life back to a changed normal. And that program is being launched this month, and it’s very important that we’re confident that works well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (50:22);Thank you. And thank you, Keith, for your questions. If I may now go to the last question, which is from Chris Young. And Chris is the local democracy reporter based at the Telegraph and Argus in Bradford. Good afternoon, Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Chris Young: (50:38);Good afternoon. The past few weeks there’s been many student nurses, paramedics, midwives called to the front line of the NHS to help with the current pandemic, and many of them in Bradford. Now due to changes made a couple of years ago by government, the current cohort, final year student nurses are having to pay their fees without the support of bursaries. And effectively, they’re having to risk their lives and use loans to pay to do that. Do you think it’s fair that these student nurses who are stepping up to help the NHS are having to get into that and risk the lives and then facing this mountain of debt afterwards? And would you support any campaign by the Telegraph and Argus and other local news organizations to have this scrapped, their tuition fees scrapped once this is all done?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (51:33);Well, thank you Chris and thank you for all the work that the Telegraph and Argus does in Bradford supporting the NHS, including those healthcare professionals who’ve chosen to come back to work in the service and who have done a fantastic job already, and many are still returning to work in the NHS and in social care. We’re very grateful for nursing and midwifery students who have chosen to go on to the frontline and help in our hospitals and care homes at this time. Those nurses and midwives who have opted in will receive the salary and the pension that is appropriate to their level. And I’m also told that the student loan company have confirmed that student loans will continue regardless of whether the individual is learning or whether, as in this case, they’ve chosen to opt in and help us in the NHS. But we’re all, I think just massively grateful for those people, for everything that they’re doing on the front line. I don’t know if Nicky, you want say anything more about the [crosstalk 00:52:39]"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (52:39);Yes, absolutely. Thank you, secretary of state. I would just echo your thanks, first of all. We’ve seen an incredible number of not just our students coming to work at a really challenging time across all the professions, but a huge number of staff coming back. So people who’ve retired or who’ve left the NHS thinking that they want to come back and work with us and support our patients. So, I’m incredibly grateful to them. We hope that some of those people who’ve returned will want to stay with us as well. So, we’re looking now to create different ways of working so that those members of staff who’ve come back and joined us can stay working with us. And that could be different ways, so digitally, remotely, working with our local practices in the case of primary care. But we really do thank them, and we really value the time that they’ve given us at a very challenging time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (53:29);Great. Thank you. Chris, is there a follow up you’d like to ask?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Chris Young: (53:33);I had just one last question. It seems like a long time ago now, but early March the government announced in the budget, a lot of support for Yorkshire and Bradford devolution and a huge amount of funding. Obviously a lot has changed since then. A lot of this funding we’re seeing is vital to help areas like Bradford regenerate. With all its change, can there be any guarantee that all these projects, this funding devolution is still going to be there or are places like Bradford back to the drawing board after this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (54:08);Well, thank you. That’s a very important question to end this afternoon’s press conference. This government was elected on a platform of leveling up and uniting the whole country, and we have absolutely no intention of stalling those plans. And in fact, unfortunately some of those places that we were already focused on, already working with, are exactly the sorts of communities and economies that are likely to be most hit by the economic disruption that’s going to come out of Coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (54:41);And so it is extremely important that we return with gusto to that agenda, and that’s absolutely what we intend to do. We will continue to devolve power to local communities in Yorkshire. As you know, at the budget, we signed a fantastic new devolution deal for leads and its surrounding economy, and we want to do more for North Yorkshire, for the Humber, and [inaudible 00:55:08] for other parts of the North of England as well. We’ll return to our work on towns, ensuring that they get the funding that they need for technology, for education and skills and infrastructure. And that work will be more important than ever as we begin to rebuild and recover the economy and move forward with the life of the country. Thank you very much, Chris. Much appreciated. And that concludes this afternoon’s press conference. Thank you very much indeed for joining us from Downing Street today."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","British officials gave a coronavirus press briefing on May 7. Dominic Raab led the briefing and said the virus not beaten, but the UK can think about next phase. Read the full speech transcript here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (14:08);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m very pleased to be joined by Sir Ian Diamond, the UK’s National Statistician from the ONS and also by Dr. Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The latest data from our Cobra coronavirus data file shows that as of today, there have now been 1, 534,533 tests for coronavirus across the UK. That includes 86,583 tests carried out yesterday, 206,715 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 5,614 cases since yesterday. Those who’ve tested positive, very sadly, 30,615 people have now died and my deepest condolences go out to anyone who’s lost a loved one throughout this pandemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (15:05);Three weeks ago, before the Easter bank holiday weekend, I set out five tests for the UK to move on to the next phase in this pandemic. Then, just as now, there were calls to ease up on the restrictions, but as the science made clear, we couldn’t responsibly do that. In fact, the advice from the group of scientific experts, SAGE, who advise the government, made it very clear that there weren’t any changes at all that we could confidently take without risking a second peak in this virus. That’s why we asked the public to keep going. We weren’t done yet. We said stick to the plan and the British public kept going. People stuck to the rules. That meant working from home, it meant worries about money, it meant adjusting to homeschooling, time apart from family and friends and just not doing many of the things that we all enjoy in life."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (15:58);At the same time, there’s been a lot of people who, despite their own personal sacrifices have gone the extra mile. They volunteer to support the elderly and the vulnerable in their community, what who have been shielded themselves away from the virus. And each Thursday, of course, we now come together to applaud the NHS staff and the carers, the people who just kept going to keep our country going. And because of that monumental effort, we’ve now passed the peak of the virus. The NHS hasn’t been overwhelmed, we haven’t seen hospital wards overwhelmed with patients, people left without hospital beds, people left without the ventilators that can mean the difference between life and death."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (16:39);Now I know the tragic death toll in this country and around the world has been sobering for all of us. And there have been real challenges in this country with PPE, with care homes. But in this first stage of the fight against COVID-19 through this national team effort, we’ve prevented the number of deaths rising to even higher levels and we’ve ensured, critically that the NHS had the capacity to cope. Today, cabinet was updated on SAGE’s advice on the progress that we’ve made to date. And as a result of the social distancing measures that we put in place, the R level, which signifies the rate of infection, is now between 0.5 and 0.9. The overall number of new cases has been steadily falling and the rate of deaths is also steadily falling."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (17:28);Now just to be clear about what all of this means in practice, the virus is not beaten yet. It remains deadly and infectious and we’re working very hard right across government and with local government to bring it down in areas of concern like in care homes. And I’m confident we can do it and we will do it. But because we held firm three weeks ago, we are now in a position to start to think about the next phase in this pandemic. So this weekend the Prime Minister will set up the next steps, which we can responsibly take over the following weeks, guided by the scientific advice and mindful, as we’ve said right from the word go of taking the right decisions at the right time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (18:13);Now we can start setting out how we will live and work whilst maintaining the necessary social distancing rules. We can also be clear about those measures which are still necessary to prevent a second peak. The Prime Minister has been directing ministers and our teams of officials right across government to carefully develop a roadmap for the next phase. It contains appropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions. And there will be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organizations. To get this right, we’ve set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (19:04);And it’s important to say this, at each point along the way, when we take these decisions, they’ll be based on the five tests and the scientific advice that we receive. And as I set out in the fifth of our five tests, when I spoke here at this lectern on the 16th of April, the point at which we make even the smallest of changes to the current guidance will be a point of maximum risk. If people abandon the social distancing, if we forget the sacrifices that were made to get us through the peak, to get us to this point, the virus will grow again at an exponential rate. That would lead to a second peak, which would threatened the NHS, it would trigger another lockdown, which would prolong the economic pain. And we’re determined to keep it temporary, to keep it as short as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (19:51);So we’ve kept the current measures in place for this long precisely so that we can bounce back with vigor and energy as soon as possible, as soon as it is responsible to start looking at the second phase. And because of that, our next steps will be surefooted and sustainable. Any changes that we make will be carefully monitored. If people don’t follow the rules or if we see that the R level goes back up, we will tighten the restrictions again. We will always retain the option to do so. That way we can safeguard public health and we can also safeguard the economy in a sustainable way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (20:27);So having prepared carefully, based on the updated advice from SAGE, this weekend the Prime Minister will set out the roadmap for the next phase along with the conditions for reaching each milestone. That way we can provide the country with a better understanding of what lies ahead. We can offer reassurance that we will adjust the restrictions to the minimum necessary to prevent a second spike in the virus and we can give people the confidence that we’re doing it in a way that will protect life and preserve our way of life. And on that note, I’ll hand over to Jenny to present the data on the latest slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (21:01);Thank you First Secretary. First slide please. Thank you. So this is just a very quick reminder of what we’re all working to achieve and the five tests that the First Secretary’s just mentioned for adjusting the lockdown. And the slides that I’ll go through now show how we’re progressing towards that. And the first thing here really is to reinforce the action that people have taken. Sorry, could you revert to the slide? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (21:36);Just to show how much people have been following those social distancing rules and really helping to bring the rate of infection down, but also to be protecting each other. So the number of people avoiding contact with vulnerable people of adults, 92% have avoided contact with vulnerable people in the last seven days. So really looking out for each other and in general, 82% have not left their home or only left their home for all the reasons that we know that you should. And that has reflected now in a much reduced R rate and the opportunities that we have going forward carefully to be adjusting the measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (22:22);I think the other interesting thing, looking forward is 44% of adults in employment have now said they’ve been working from home at sometime in the last week, significantly changed from the 12% for the same time last year. And that helps the social distancing, but I think it also perhaps helps people recognize other opportunities for how they can work in the future. Next slide please. So here we see the daily tests, which have increased. So the tests yesterday or rather up to 9:00 this morning carried out were 86,500. There has been a little bit of a technical hitch in the lab over the weekend, but that’s now starting to rise again and we will see in the following slides how that translates through to a detection of disease. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (23:20);And here we have on this slide, so the blue pillar there is the NHS swab testing. The rates of case detection are coming down. These are primarily within healthcare settings in hospitals, but the orange pillars on the top there represent the increased capacity and numbers of tests that are being carried out. And obviously we hope overall that our case numbers will come down, but in this intervening period while testing is increasing, then we expect those orange pillars to grow. So we will have increased case detection, but we want to watch the blue pillars coming down as they are now. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (24:05);And this slide, which we’ve seen before, but I think with some trepidation at the top of those peaks, we can now see that just about all regions have come right back down to relatively low levels compared with the peak. Of course, I say relatively, that’s for the number of people in hospitals, that still represents a huge workload for NHS frontline staff. But it does show a decrease of 16% over the last week. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (24:42);And again, reflected from that last slide is the use of critical care beds. At one time there was obviously concern that with the rising epidemic we would have sufficient capacity. There was a plan to manage that and now less than a third of critical care beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients. And that’s been decreasing right across the UK over the last two weeks. Next slide."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (25:10);And here we have the seven day rolling average. Now obviously sitting behind this are recorded deaths, none of which we would wish to be there. But on the positive side of that is the fact that we can see the rise in the epidemic peak and the subsequent later deaths. There were 539 deaths in all settings following in the last period, but the seven day rolling average now is a midweek one, which is the most robust figure. We can see the variation over the weekend periods in that slide and this is the lowest I think that has been… We’ve seen since the end of March. Again, really importantly that all the social distancing measures, all the things that we’ve been doing, we need to keep doing to maintain that gradual decline in the line. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (26:04);And then finally, just a quick comparison. It’s important that we compare data internationally and this is global desk comparison, but as we’ve mentioned frequently, there are variations in how different countries measure those deaths and these are numbers rather than rates. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (26:23);Jenny, thank you very much. I think we’ve got a string of questions and first of all, Thomas from London."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Thomas: (26:29);Is it safe to lift any lockdown measures, considering that our track and trace system is not yet operational and that our comparatively slow decline in daily deaths means that we have little margin for error?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (26:40);How safe is it to lift any lockdown measures? Well Thomas, thank you very much for that question. I think you’ve nailed it. We’ve got the latest data from SAGE. We have come through the peak but it is a very delicate, and as I said before, a very dangerous moment. So we do need to proceed with caution. The Prime Minister is going to set out a roadmap and that will not just include the kinds of things that we’re looking at doing, but the criteria to make sure that we make surefooted steps. And we can monitor very carefully any changes incrementally we make to make sure that we don’t see the virus get back its grip on this country and see the R rate as it’s been explained here this afternoon go back up."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (27:21);So yes, there is an opportunity to move to the second phase and start looking towards that, but it has to be done very carefully, subject to strict conditions, with strict monitoring to make sure that we do it in a controlled and sustainable way. Thank you for your question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (27:38);I think we’ve got one from Brandon from Warrington now. Brandon asks, how does the government intend to control ongoing outbreaks in prisons, particularly in terms of balancing the rights of prisoners against the health and safety of prison staff and their families, which is being put at significant risk? I have to say, I think the prison system and all of those prison officers have done an incredible job. Of course, there’s concern around-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (28:03);Of course, there’s concern around COVID-19 in prisons, both for staff but also for offenders. We’ve got a plan in place, which has meant that that hasn’t become a major issue, but we take nothing for granted. We’re not complacent about it for a moment. I spoke to the justice equity this week. We’re monitoring it very carefully, but actually we’re confident that we have the situation under control. I think we’re going to move over to the media now. Laura Kuenssberg from the BBC. You were mute, Laura. I don’t know if that’s at your end or."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Laura Kuenssberg: (28:48);That should be okay now. Can you hear me?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (28:50);Well done. Don’t worry. That’s not your quota of questions gone."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Laura Kuenssberg: (28:55);Thanks very much. Can you just confirm on point of fact, are you renewing the restrictions today as you have to do under the legislation? And Nicola Sturgeon has said it’s potentially catastrophic to move away from the stay at home message. Given that the disease is still prevalent in many parts of the country, are you really sure that it is safe to lift any of the restrictions, however gradual rolling down the lockdown, rolling back the lockdown might be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Laura Kuenssberg: (29:24);And if I could ask Dr. Harris, you said that the R is somewhere between.5 and. 9, can you tell people exactly what the R level is in different parts of the country given that it’s such a key factor in how the decisions will be made?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (29:39);Thanks, Laura. Well first of all, I think whether you’re in London [inaudible 00:29:43] or Belfast as we enter another long bank holiday weekend, I think the message is very clear, follow the guidance. To answer your question, there is no change today in the guidance or in the rules, but as I’ve also explained, the prime minister will set out a roadmap on Sunday. And of course we are locked into the closest cooperation collaboration with the devolved administrations through Cobra, but also the prime minister spoke to the first ministers today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (30:11);He reiterated our commitment to continuing a UK-wide approach to tackling the pandemic even if different parts may move at slightly different speeds. But I think the key thing is that those decisions are made based on the science and the circumstances for each nation. Ian, do you want to comment on the other point that was raised?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Ian: (30:32);The question that was asked is what is the R around the UK and clearly there is some variation and we are absolutely working with some fantastic estimates that are done by our modeling community. And I think that the consensus is that it is below one everywhere, lowest probably in London, but certainly some variation across the different regions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (30:59);Laura, would you like a followup question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Laura Kuenssberg: (31:02);Yeah. Can I just end it on the on that point? Is it possible to give us those exact numbers? But also just to you, Foreign Secretary, you stood there at that same lector and time after time and said that it would be wrong to talk about lifting any kind of restrictions because you might give people the wrong impression, but isn’t that exactly what the government risks doing now ahead of what looks like being a very sunny bank holiday weekend when many people are just desperate to get out?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (31:25);First of all, I’ve said very clearly, so I’m very happy to say it again, that there’s no change in the rules today. What the prime minister will do is set out on Sunday a roadmap that can look to the future and explain what steps will be taken at what moment in time and critically the evidence that will back it up. We’ve always said consistently from the outset, we’ve got to take the right decisions at the right moment in time, guided by the evidence that is consistently what we’ve said from the outset and that approach is continuing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (31:54);Is there anything else you can say on the R?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Ian: (31:55);No, I think, I mean I’m quite happy to produce them later, but we don’t have them right in front of me now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (32:02);Laura, thanks very much. Libby Wiener from the ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Libby Wiener: (32:08);Yes. Hello, Foreign Secretary. Thanks very much. This afternoon, one of your advisors, Professor John Edmonds told MPs that transmission in the community was no longer a problem. He suggested that the epidemic was now centered on hospitals and care homes. Do you accept that the government blundered in not focusing on these particularly vulnerable areas earlier and that’s why the lockdown is having to go on for so long for the rest of us?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (32:38);Well first of all, it’s good news that the R level has come down overall. That’s because of the measures we put in place because when I stood here before the Easter bank holiday we said, we’ve got to stick to our guns here. And frankly because of the efforts of the public in following that guidance and indeed the brilliant essential workers in the NHS care homes and otherwise. We have definitely got a challenge in care homes. The CQC data that came out, I think, yesterday showed that overall in care homes, the number of deaths was down by over 300 on the last week, so that’s positive, but there is still a very significant issue in care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (33:18);Jenny and I were in a Cross Whitehall meeting yesterday. We’re looking at exactly how we ramp up every bit of what we need to do around the social distancing in care homes, the ebb and flow of people into care homes, the PPE, the testing to make sure we bear down on this problem. And you’re right as well, there’s also an issue in hospitals. So it’s good news that overall that we’ve got control across the country, but of course as we’ve always said, we got to make sure that we see consistent falls in the death rate and the infection rate across all settings and that’s how we will continue with our approach."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Ian: (33:51);Could I also just say that Professor Edmonds would also have said, and I would certainly say, that in early March as we started to move towards the policies that the public had been so wonderful in taking place. We were doubling the size of the epidemic every three days. And I think if you look at the graph that Dr. Harris showed earlier, you see a very steep upward curve. The fact that it is coming down now is because I believe of the success that ONS has been measuring as many other people of the lockdown measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (34:24);Libby, would you like to follow up on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Libby Wiener: (34:26);Yes. Can I ask on another topic? Essentially there is a huge amount of data now suggesting that black adults in this country are particularly vulnerable, perhaps the death rate is something like four times that for the equivalent people of white ethnicity. The government said it’s looking into it. Are you actually going to do something about it to protect, for example, frontline workers from these ethnic groups?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (34:58);Well look, first of all, we’re very concerned about it. It’s something we take very seriously. We are learning more about this virus all the time because it’s new and we’ve asked Public Health England to look very carefully at all of the implications and how it is affecting different communities, but particularly the BME community. And once we’ve got the advice back from them, we’ll know what interventions can sensibly be made. And that’s the way, again, as we’ve said throughout, we need the scientific evidence to back up any policy decisions that we would want to make in that front."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (35:34);Thank you. Libby. Beth Rigby from Sky News."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Beth Rigby: (35:37);Thank you. First Secretary of State, the prime minister said in the commons yesterday that there will be changes to the lockdown from Monday, and millions of people would have read that that will include more outdoor exercise and sunbathing. And yet today, you’re saying that they must adhere to the lockdown ahead of a statement on Sunday as we go into this sunny bank holiday weekend. Can you see how the public will find this really confusing? Do we sunbathe on Monday but not on Sunday? And just to follow up on Libby’s question, should BME people now be shielding as they are potentially more vulnerable and at greater risk of catching and dying from coronavirus?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (36:23);Well in relation to the BME question, we’ll take decisions as policymakers when we’ve got clear advice from PHE on the causes and the implications and what we could responsibly do. I think that’s the responsible thing for ministers to do. In relation to any next changes or any second phase that we’re going to be guided by the evidence. We’ve had updated evidence from Sage. There’s further evidence that is coming through and we obviously have to take those decisions at the right moment in time based on that evidence. And whatever’s being reported in the newspapers is not a reliable guide to either the evidence that we’re getting or the policy decisions that we’ll be taking."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (37:05);And so that’s why it’s very important that prime minister on Sunday will set out a roadmap. I think it’s safe to say that any changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental, and very carefully monitored. And as of now, there is no changes. But the key thing is that we want to give in a responsible and a sure footed way a sense of the roadmap ahead coupled with the milestones and the conditions so that people have the reassurance and the confidence, yes, that we’ll protect life and preserve our way of life, but that we’re doing it in a responsible way."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (37:38);And of course if we find, and this is very important at this stage in the virus, not just for the UK, but for others at the similar stage having come through the peak. If we find in the future that the R level goes back up or that we find that people aren’t following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place and that is the way we can responsibly go through this stage and transition into a second phase. But as we’ve always said, Beth, we’re going to take the right decisions at the right time. And so for the moment it is really important, particularly as people look towards a warm bank holiday weekend, that we continue to follow the guidance in place at this time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (38:17);Beth, did you want to come back with?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Beth Rigby: (38:19);Yeah. Just given that we’re going into the bank holiday and you are formally rolling over the lockdown, isn’t it unhelpful if the prime minister says on Wednesday that he wants to roll, that there might be changes on Monday and then he doesn’t turn up today to tell the British public what those changes might be ahead of the bank holiday?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (38:41);Well, sorry, Beth, that’s simply just not the case. And I’ve set out what we’re doing with explaining that the prime minister on Sunday when we’ve compiled all the evidence and we can do so in a responsible surefooted fashion will set out the roadmap ahead. Any measures that will be taken next week will be relatively modest, incremental steps, carefully monitored, subject to all of the qualifications that we’ve already set. But we will set out a roadmap with milestones, maximum conditionality on that so that we can make sure we take surefooted steps."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (39:10);So I know you’re desperate to know what he’s going to say on Sunday, but I’m not going to jump the gun. We’ve always said we’ll take the right decisions at the right moment. Thank you very much, Beth. Chris Smyth from The Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Chris Smyth: (39:23);Thank you. Draw out a couple of things. Firstly, temperature testing is not something we’ve done before because on this case it’s not a panacea. But in places like South Korea, it’s a regular part of being allowed into airports, workplaces, restaurants, and it’s been reported that we’re looking at that here. So is that the next lesson we’re going to learn from Asia. And then following up Libby’s question. I mean Professor Edmonds also said this afternoon there are about 20,000 new infections of coronavirus every day at the moment and can I ask Sir Ian, he’s obviously studying this if he agrees and if not what his estimate is?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Chris Smyth: (39:58);First Secretary, you put quite a wide estimate on R and Professor Edmonds also said it was very much a higher end of that, so just below one and indeed higher than it was two weeks ago, largely because of what was happening in hospitals and care homes. So is that a concern and how much is that delaying how much we can loosen restrictions?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (40:17);Chris, you managed to squeeze in three questions there, very craftly done. So in relation to the R, all I’ve done is articulate the R level and the range that was explained to us. In relation to any potential restrictions at the border coming into this country, those will be announced in due course and sensible way. I’m not sure. I think the evidence so far has always been that temperature tests are not particularly effective way of proceeding. But I think the critical thing, and we’ve taken advice on board and measures and I’ve asked consistently this question to CMOs, deputy CMOs, chief scientific advisors and all the other scientists."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (40:56);And I think the evidence suggests that you would, once you’ve got the, there’s not much point in taking those measures until the R level is down below a certain point. But as you start to get control of it, what you don’t want is the virus receding in the UK, the source of that being from abroad and that is the point at which you would want to consider restrictions or monitoring at the border. I don’t know whether … Please do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (41:20);So just add a comment to that because I think also you were referring to potential use in other environments, so restaurants and things like that, which I think is a routine part of South Korean working. I mean, I think there is a strong reassurance mechanism for the public. But as I’ve said previously, if you have a disease and it has an incubation period of say up to 14 days, the likelihood of finding somebody at the point where they have a temperature and you have a reliable bit of kit. So most of thermal scanners will be distracted, if you like, from environmental color, density and temperatures as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (41:56);So you need a reliable bit of kit, but even then your chance of picking somebody up is very small. But-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (42:02);… of picking somebody up is very small, but it can have a reassurance mechanism, I think, and the other really important thing in relation to COVID-19 is a sizable proportion, up to about a third of people do not have a temperature at presentation. They may have it variably through the illness or they don’t have it. They come with …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (42:19);We’re learning more as we go through about the symptoms and signs that people have, so I don’t think we could expect that. We want to catch people, if you like, in the early phase of the disease where they’re most likely to transmit, and not all of them will have a temperature."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (42:34);[Sir Ian 00:00:34]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (42:35);You asked a question about whether I agreed with Professor Edmonds. I think we’re incredibly lucky in this country to have mathematicians of the quality of Professor Edmonds and the others in the various teams around the UK who are making those estimates. They are based on new data every time, they make two estimates a week and I think I would personally support them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (43:05);Over the next few weeks, they will be getting extra data through a very large study that the ONS is doing together with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester Wellcome Trust, which will provide, if you like, direct community evidence both on the number infected at any particular time, number of people infected at a particular time and also the number of people who have had, at some stage, the virus and therefore have an antibody to it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (43:35);And those data, as they become available on a weekly basis over the next while, will inform those numbers even more. But to answer your question straight, I’m very happy with those numbers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (43:47);Chris, did you have a follow up? Maybe just limit yourself to the one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Chris: (43:50);Yeah, so on R then, I mean the fact that it is higher than it was two weeks ago, is that delaying what we can do and does it mean we have to wait for the outbreak in care homes to be under control?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (44:04);Well, I probably should defer. I’m not sure, the range [crosstalk 00:44:07] Sorry. Go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (44:07);Sorry. No, no."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (44:08);You fire away."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (44:11);The R … [inaudible 00:44:11] is right that R has probably gone up just a little bit from his last estimates and that is driven by the epidemic in care homes, he would say and I would not demur from that. That gives us a real challenge to reduce the epidemic in care homes and it’s one that I think over the next few weeks, from what I see happening, I think will happen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (44:35);It is important to recognize that the R number itself is only relevant if you look also at the context of the prevalence, and I think we need to bring the two together properly to understand where we are. Let me just give you an example, and Secretary, if you wouldn’t mind me being technical for a minute."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (44:56);Please do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (44:56);If you imagine a situation where we have the prevalence at.00001 or even.000001, so in other words, tiny, tiny numbers and that is the same every week, then the R would be 1 because it’s flatlining. That is so important that we always think about R in the context of the prevalence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (45:22);That’s why I think at the moment we need certainly to get on top of the epidemic in the care homes and in hospitals. I know Dr. Harries would be able to comment. There’s an awful lot of work going on in those arenas, but I do think also that in the community we have things relatively low at the moment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (45:41);So, overall the R level is down, but there’s obviously clearly a challenge that remains in care homes. Although again, I just point to the CQC data, which shows that the number of deaths is down over 300 on this time last week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (45:55);But the reality is our top focus is on the hospital infections and on the care home settings. We’ve got a very robust and rigorous plan to really drive down the infection rate in those two settings over the next month and we’re confident we can deliver on that. Jenny, I don’t know if there’s anything you’d add on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (46:14);Well, just to reinforce what you’re saying, I think. There are a number of things that you can do to try and support care homes and support residents in them. I think we need to focus equally not just on the residents but on the staff as well, because these are quite closed communities, if you like."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (46:32);We’ve been talking about the R in the community where everybody has done so well to bring that number down, but of course, workers who are working in care and health settings also are part of their local communities, so we need to make sure that we address infection prevention and control measures and really make them robust."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (46:52);We test now. We have always been testing for outbreaks, but I think we’re getting new information coming through about asymptomatic infection and how that particularly presents in the elderly, excuse me, and of course those are the people who are probably most at risk."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (47:09);So, using that new evidence, increased testing and increased focus and also new support coming in from NHS England in terms of giving clinical support to our care homes, I think that focus will be … Well, we’ve seen some positive signs already and I’m sure that will continue."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (47:28);The single biggest challenge we’ve got in care homes is the ebb and flow of people in and out of them, particularly when they’re not showing signs of having the virus. At least that’s something we can control and really focus on with a laser-like precision and that’s what we’ll do. Chris, thanks very much. Macer Hall from the Express?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Macer Hall: (47:46);Thank you, Foreign Secretary. To Dr. Harries, what’s the latest medical thinking about the impact of warm weather on the virus? Is there any danger that any lockdown restrictions that are eased over the summer months may have to be reimposed over in the autumn because of seasonal variations?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Macer Hall: (48:05);And Foreign Secretary, a question about the government’s contact tracing app. People who download this app face being asked to go into isolation possibly multiple times if they come into contact with people who’ve reported symptoms. Will they be entitled to sick pay or will their employers be entitled to any compensation if they’re forced to go into isolation again and again?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (48:30);Well, just on that, I think you’re jumping the gun a little bit on the guidance, but the key thing is I think it will be a liberating thing for people because, and indeed for the country as a whole because it will allow people who might have the symptoms to be clear that they don’t have coronavirus and therefore not be subject to all of those restrictions, and that’s the most important thing. It will actually allow people to get out of the isolation measures earlier than otherwise would be the case. Jenny, on …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (48:57);Yes. Specifically about the issue about weather, I think obviously, it’s a new virus and we are still learning about it and so I would like to leave the evidence base open a little bit. But when we first learned about it, of course, if we look at something like seasonal flu, there was a possibility that it might behave in the same way and in that way we might imagine that in the warmer weather now we would see a decline."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (49:18);But if you look around the world, we’re seeing epidemics in warm and cooler climate. So, I think probably not a lot of evidence there, but your point about lockdown and the winter is a really important one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (49:31);I don’t think it particularly relates to lockdown, but it does relate very much to active work now, first in pushing, as we push and we’re more successful in pushing that peak forward, which we’ve seen. We definitely don’t want a second peak and we don’t want it in the winter because people will be suffering from other winter infections, so they will be increasingly debilitated."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (49:54);So, all the work that’s ongoing now, we must do safely as the First Secretary said, but equally it’s probably a good place for me as a public health doctor to advertise all go and get your flu jabs this year. Really, really important that people maintain their health and take every preventative measure that they can."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (50:10);Thanks, Jenny. Macer, did you have any followups there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Macer Hall: (50:11);No, that’s fine, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (50:11);Brilliant. Good to speak to you. Gemma Crew from PA. Final question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Gemma Crew: (50:18);Thank you and good afternoon. We’ve heard about 20,000 people a day are still being affected. On Saturday, my colleague asked whether you know of where people are contracting the virus and I believe you said you had the data but not to hand."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Gemma Crew: (50:32);Could we ask again, are people picking it up in supermarkets, public transport or is it predominantly care homes and hospitals? As surely this is quite a vital part of the lockdown easing decision making process."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (50:46);Well, let’s … Jenny talked about the wider statistical picture, but as has already been explained, the evidence that’s been provided to us is that overall we’ve got the rate of infection down across the country and particularly in the community. The two areas where there are specific concerns are care homes and hospital infections and we have a very clear concerted plan that covers everything from cohorting and the social distancing through to testing and PPE. So, we’re not complacent for a moment in those two settings, but we do have a plan that we’re delivering to bring it right down. Jenny, is there anything-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (51:22);I should add to that … Yes, I mean, to reinforce that, I think that’s where our focus of attention is going forward and where we think cases are potentially going to be at the higher end whilst those in the community are dropping off."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (51:33);It’s very difficult to say precisely where an individual caught their disease because we’re exposed to, we have multiple exposures all the time and at a time of pandemic when an infection is fairly widespread, it’s difficult to pinpoint that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (51:49);We can look in some ways, so for example, looking at different transmissions in the chain of transmission and seeing where the most risks are. Actually, when we do that, most of the transmissions are at home, so the home environment is a very strong environment for finding linked cases."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dr. Jenny Harries: (52:07);But equally there’s some really good genomics work ongoing at the moment, which will give us really good data, I think going forward to understand where the chains of transmission are and actually where they came into the country from."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Sir Ian: (52:20);I would just add one thing if I may. All the data that we are looking at shows the success of social distancing and if I make it a personal view, then I do believe that social distancing and maintaining it over the next few weeks is going to be central to continuing to reducing the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (52:42);Gemma, did you want a supplementary last question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Gemma Crew: (52:46);Yeah, thank you. Can I just ask, you said moments ago about the problem being the ebb and flow of people into care homes. Doesn’t that underline the need to probably get testing back up to 100,000 a day? And can I ask if you’re considering testing people, relatives that might be wanting to visit loved ones before they go into care homes?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (53:07);I think the challenge, and it’s actually similar in hospital settings as in care homes, is people who are not showing symptoms but who have coronavirus passing it on. The speed with which we can detect that, testing is part of that, but also it’s the movement of people in and out of those settings, which is fueling that transmission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (53:28);They’re both parts of that problem. There’s not a silver bullet here. It’s about putting all the different bits of the jigsaw together and having a strategic, holistic approach."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-7","Dominic Raab: (53:36);We’re confident now we’ve got enough information, we’ve got the data and we’ve got the plan in place now to really drive down the infection rates in hospitals but also in care homes. Gemma, thank you very much. And that brings an end to this press conference. Thank you all very much."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","British officials gave a coronavirus press briefing on May 8. Secretary of State for Environment George Eustice led today’s briefing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (08:11);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m pleased to be joined today by Steve Powis, the Medical Director of NHS England. And before we give an update on the latest figures on the coronavirus and also our work to help support the vulnerable get access to food. Today is of course the 75th anniversary of VE Day. And although many of the lockdown measures that are in place and the social distancing measures that are in place, mean that many of the planned events have been unable to take place as originally envisaged. Today is an important day to pause and remember, and 75 years ago, people poured into the streets of our scarred cities to celebrate the end of that most difficult conflict. Our soldiers fought around the world. There were countless acts of bravery. 450,000 British people sadly lost their lives. And it was a moment when our whole country pulled together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (09:15);As DEFRA secretary, I would like to take this opportunity to recall the efforts of those who also contributed in a nonmilitary way. In particular, our farmers, who stepped up to ensure that the nation was fed. And the many women who responded to the call to join the Women’s Land Army. In a moment, I am going to give you an update on our work to support the vulnerable get access to food. But, firstly let me give you an update on the latest data from the Cobra coronavirus data file."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (09:48);I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program. As of today, 1,631,561 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK. Including 97,029 tests carried out yesterday. 211,364 people have tested positive. And that’s an increase of 4,649 cases since yesterday. 11,788 people are currently in hospital with the coronavirus, down from 12,688 the previous day. And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus across all settings, 31,241 have now died. That’s an increase of 626 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings, not just in hospitals. And we express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of these victims."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (10:59);Turning now to our work to help the vulnerable get access to food. Firstly, for the so-called shielded cohort, that’s those who are clinically vulnerable. Over a million food parcels have now been delivered to these households. And in addition, all of those on the shielded cohort have been added to a list giving them priority access to supermarket delivery slots. So far, around 400,000 people have been offered priority delivery slots by supermarkets and around one million orders have been placed. Ensuring that people can shop normally and purchase the goods that they want to buy. There is of course a wider vulnerable group, those perhaps who have disabilities, or who are elderly and perhaps don’t have neighbors or relatives close by to help them, or indeed those with other conditions that don’t put them in the clinically shielded group. But, nevertheless make them vulnerable. And we’ve been working with local authorities and some of the leading charities, such as Age UK, to put together a package of support to help these people get access to food."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (12:14);And many local authorities and charities have also been accessing the Good Samaritan app as part of the NHS responder volunteer program. And so far, 79,000 shopping runs have been carried out by volunteers engaged in that program. In addition, we are continuing to work with supermarkets to make available additional priority slots for those in this group. But, we also recognize that the economic impacts of coronavirus means that vulnerability is not just about physical access to food. For some, there is also financial vulnerability. So today we are announcing a new 16 million pound fund to support frontline food charities."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (13:03);The fund will be used by fair share and wrap to continue and support and increase the food redistribution work that they already do, and will significantly expand their sourcing capacity. They will be delivering food to around 5,000 frontline charities, and these include refuges, homeless shelters and rehabilitation centers. Finally, I’m concious that there is a great deal of speculation about what the prime minister might say on Sunday when he outlines a roadmap for the future and how we will evolve the current restrictions. The prime minister will outline any changes to the guidance on Sunday, but in the meantime, in spite of the sunny bank holiday, it is vitally important that we continue to abide by the current restrictions, stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (14:03);Thank you secretary of state. I’d like to start by paying tribute on VE day to every member of the armed forces and in particular the many doctors, nurses, and other clinicians who serve in our military. The NHS was founded as part of the reconstruction of our country after the second world war, and since it has grown into the most trusted organization in the country. Along with our armed forces and other public service organizations, the NHS is a rock for people in times of uncertainty. And as we’ve all found our way through this global pandemic, I’m proud of the partnership that the NHS and our armed forces have forged to give people the help that they need. In constructing the Nightingales, our extra capacity to back up existing intensive care services, the army and the NHS has worked hand in hand and achieved something quite extraordinary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (14:57);I know my colleagues working on the frontline of the NHS have been extremely grateful for all the help that the military have offered government in the distribution of protective equipment. So today as we celebrate the service and dedication of our armed forces personnel, I want to remind those serving in the military that the NHS repays your service with tailored care. Whether that’s physical rehabilitation or specialist mental health care in particular to help veterans to make the transition into civilian life. While a growing number of veterans have been referred for help year on year, latest data indicates a drop in the number of people reaching out to specialist services in April. So for any military families watching today, remember that if you need medical help, as is the same for anybody who needs help, particularly emergency help, then please come to us in the NHS. I’d now like to move to the daily presentation of data slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (15:54);The first slide is a reminder that I won’t go in detail today because you have seen it many times before of the five tests that the government has set for adjusting the lockdown. In the next slide, we have a slide as usual looking at how the public have been complying with the social distancing instructions that we’ve all been given. This is data from Google, and it shows a seven day rolling average of the mobility of the public in various places. And you will see when it comes to transport and retail and recreation and the workplace, there has been a dramatic reduction since the social distancing measures were introduced. A little bit of an uptick in workplaces, but I would remind you that people are clearly working in some workplaces, although many, many are working from home. One other thing to pointed out in parks, you will see that there’s a bit of variation in use of parks which I’m sure is consistent with sunny weather and people going out a little bit more."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (17:05);In the next slide, we look at the daily tests. You’ve heard the data for yesterday and you will see that there has been an increase in the number of tests at the end of April and into May. In the next slide you will see how that testing capacity is reflected in new cases. You will see a steady number of new cases being reported and these, are remember, are those individuals who test positive in the testing program. But as the capacity has increased, that number has not increased dramatically reflecting that the social distancing measures are being complied with, are working, and overall the spread of this virus is reducing in the community."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (17:52);In the next slide we show how that translates into those that unfortunately have to receive hospital care, and again remember that for the majority of people over 80% this is a mild illness, flu like illness that you can stay at home with, but for some it does require hospital admission. And you will see that hospital admissions peaked and plateaued around the middle of April, and since they had been falling. Most obviously in London where the number of cases was highest, but also maybe a little bit more slowly but certainly in other parts of the UK, and there has now been quite a decrease in the number of people in hospital with COVID-19."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (18:39);Then for the sickest patients, in the next slide you can see the usage of critical care beds for patients who have COVID-19. Again a minority, but these are the sickest patients who require the most intensive care. This shows a proportion of beds and you can see that that proportion has again been falling since the middle of April and is now down at below a third, and the absolute numbers of patients in critical care beds with COVID-19 is similarly falling."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (19:09);Then finally we show data on deaths and sadly you will have just heard of another 626 deaths in all settings today. But you can also see from this slide that when looking at the seven day rolling average, which means that we can correct for changes from day to day, there, again, is a decline in overall deaths that, again, has been occurring from the middle to end of April. And then last is the international comparison. This shows the UK all settings now with a lag on it … I’m sorry, not with a leg on it but UK all settings set from particular start point for all countries, and again the usual caveats that we gave. The comparisons between different countries is difficult and it will only be excess mortality, all cause mortality over a period of time of the pandemic that will be probably the best way to make this sort of comparison. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (20:13);Thank you Stephen. And we’ll now turn to questions, starting with our first member of the public with a question and that’s Alex from [inaudible 00:07:22]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Alex: (20:21);What is happening with Brexit and the COVID-19 lockdown? Has it been put on hold or are you still going ahead with it?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (20:31);Thank you very much Alex. We’re still going ahead with it. Brexit in fact is something that has already happened. We left the European union at the end of January. We have a transition period that ends at the end of this year, and we will still be ending that transition period on time as planned, and we are still doing whatever planning is necessary to ensure that after that transition period we can trade normally, and function normally as a country. Turning now to Heidi from Rumford, and Heidi’s question is how will the contact app work properly when a lot of the older generation do not have smart things? They are the ones that need to know who has COVID-19 the most, though they won’t know and will still be in danger. Well, Heidi, I will start by trying to answer that, and Stephen might also come in with some additional points. The important thing about the new tracing app that we are working on is it’s quite critical as we start to evolve the restrictions we have and move from a complete lockdown of the country to one where we enable people to move around and perhaps to travel to work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (21:46);As we get to that point, having that accurate data locally of if there is an outbreak in an infection and somebody tests positive, being able to have anybody who’s been in close contact with them to self isolate is very important. The work that we’ve done suggests that if you’ve got around 60% of the population on this app, then it would become highly effective, but even at lower rates than that, it would be effective. We do recognize that some elderly people may not have a mobile phone and may not have an app, but also many will have family who’d be able to support them to get such an app. And of course some of those, particularly the shielded group may indeed continue to stay at home for longer periods of times and protect themselves. Stephen, is there anything to add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (22:36);Yes. A very, very good question. So yes, it is that some of older generation do not have smartphones, although it’s also true that many do. And I know from my experience in healthcare not to underestimate the benefits that technology such as smartphones can bring to the older generation and and many of the older generation do indeed use this technology. And of course the older generation are not the only people in society who may not have a smartphone. So it’s absolutely correct that the app will not be the only way in which we will be able to monitor and track down people or track down contacts of people who have coronavirus going forward. It will be an important part, but it will not be the only part."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (23:23);Thank you Stephen, and the next question we’ve got is Ben Wright from the BBC. Go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Ben Wright: (23:29);Thank you, secretary of state. We don’t want to preempt the prime minister, but today the Welsh government has announced some modest changes to their down rules before the prime minister speaks on Sunday. Can we expect those measures to be mirrored in England and what can you as the UK government do to ensure the public receive a very clear message?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (23:51);Well, look Ben, our very clear message today is that even though it’s going to be a sunny bank holiday, it is absolutely essential that people abide by the current restrictions and stay at home and don’t succumb to the temptation to go out and about. And we will have to wait for what the prime minister has to say on Sunday. But I think what I can say is this. He’s going to set out effectively a roadmap of how we can evolve the current restrictions we have, this complete lockdown at the moment, to something where certain activities may become possible in the short term, in the near term and other things might take much longer. We have to be realistic that there isn’t going to be any dramatic overnight change. We will be very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have. As the data that we’re outlining on a daily basis shows we are not out of the woods."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (24:46);There are still major challenges with this virus. We will be living with this virus for some time to come and it’s important to avoid that second peak that could overwhelm our NHS, that we exit and evolve these restrictions very, very carefully. I would also say this. We work very closely with all of the devolved administrations. They attend the COVID meetings when some of these matters are discussed, and as far as possible while each devolved administration has obviously got the freedom to have slightly different approaches, as far as possible, we are all working together to try to have a broadly similar UK approach. Did you want to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Ben Wright: (25:27);Yeah. Just yesterday’s briefing, we were promised more data on how the R rate varies across the country nationally and regionally. When are we going to see that data and is it the case that the R rate has to be universally low across all four nations before we can expect to see a significant lifting of the lockdown?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (25:46);I’d like to ask Stephen whether he can pick up on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (25:50);Yes. So far I can’t give you the data by region. I think what has been said of the R is somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. It undoubtedly will vary from place to place and it will vary over time from place to place."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (26:03);The important thing is that as a whole that it stays below one. The five tests that were in the original, the initial slide I showed, I went through them quickly, but you will know what they are and you’ve just heard that one of them is to ensure that we don’t risk a second peak and we don’t risk putting pressure on our health service that overwhelms it. To do that it is a requirement to make sure that R is below one and the number of new cases in the community is not rising. So, it will vary across geographies. It will vary from time to time, but the important thing is to keep it below one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (26:43);Okay. Thank you very much Ben, and we’ll now turn to Carl Dinnen from ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Carl Dinnen: (26:49);Thank you, Secretary of State. Are you disappointed given the news from the Welsh First Minister today, that the four nations don’t look like they will be taking exactly the same approach to the handling of this virus?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (27:06);Well, look, the devolved administrations do obviously have competence over some of these issues, some of these measures. From the beginning some of them have done slightly different things to England, but generally speaking we’ve taken similar approaches and we’ve been in step, even though there have been some slight differences. I don’t think we need to get too worked up about timings of different announcements. Scotland made some comments, obviously last week. Wales has today. The prime minister will be setting out his approach and that roadmap and how we intend to evolve these restrictions on Sunday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Carl Dinnen: (27:45);Can I ask if the restrictions are going to evolve and that suggests that in some ways something might be eased. How are you going to monitor whether or not you’ve been able to do that without risking a resurgence of the virus, without significantly more testing than you’re currently able to do?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (28:07);Well, I think the first thing I must stress is that any evolution of the current restrictions will be done with the utmost of caution. There isn’t going to be dramatic change in the short term. We will be cautiously making some changes where we think those can be considered. The prime minister will be setting out a timetable for other changes as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (28:33);In terms of how we monitor things, we do now have quite a substantial surveillance program that’s being run by ONS, where we are doing sample data, testing people to get an understanding of the prevalence of this disease. Further work like that, particularly on a regional basis, will help us to understand trends in the disease. Obviously, we also have the daily data that we’ve publishing now regularly from our coronavirus file, which actually shows some of the key indicators in terms of new infections."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (29:10);So we will be monitoring this very, very closely as any changes are made. I don’t know, Steven, if you wanted to add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (29:16);Yeah. In monitoring infectious diseases in the community, including in epidemics, it’s really important to have a range of different things that you measure as part of an overall surveillance system. In fact, the data that is presented every day in the slides that I’ve shown you earlier, that data is part of that surveillance system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (29:36);So admissions into hospital. Deaths, unfortunately is part of that surveillance system. Positive test cases is part of that system. Each winter during the flu season, in fact we run surveillance, public health runs surveillance mechanisms that look at presentation of symptoms, of flu like symptoms, to general practice through to the number of people testing positive for influenza. So there are well-established surveillance processes and I think the key going forward will be to ensure that we have a similar surveillance system for COVID. But it is likely to include, not only the data that you are familiar with, but other data as it becomes available. It won’t be just one thing. It will be a range of indicators."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (30:25);Thank you. Moving on now to Liz Bates from Channel 4. Liz."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Liz Bates: (30:30);Yes, thank you. Channel 4 News revealed last night that millions of out of date PP products were distributed to frontline workers. Public Health England say they were tested and that they were found to be safe, but that they won’t release the results of those tests. So can you tell us now, why those test results won’t be released?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (30:56);Steven, can I?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (30:57);My understanding, as the government releases the PPE equipment and delivers it to hospitals and other settings, is that any items that have gone past their original date of expiry are retested to ensure that they still keep, are still at the right standards and they would not be distributed unless they had been retested to meet those standards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (31:32);Okay. Does that explain it? So they would’ve been retested."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Liz Bates: (31:34);I have another question if that’s okay?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (31:34);Yes. Okay."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Liz Bates: (31:34);Just, we’ve been speaking to people in care homes today, still desperate for testing, particularly for their staff. They’ve been directed to a hotline. If you call, it says, “Sorry, there’s no tests available today, call back tomorrow.” Why can they still not get the tests that they need?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (31:54);Well look, I think the reality is with the testing, we’ve now got around 90 different mobile test centers and another 50 or so drive-through, right around the country. It’s inevitable when you’re trying to use up all of that capacity, we’ve got over 100,000 test capacity now, it’s inevitable that there will in some regions perhaps not be sufficient numbers in some days and there will be daily fluctuations. It’s possibly the case that they can’t get an immediate test on that day, but they should be able to get one quickly, because we do not have the capacity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (32:31);Today we’ve got the figures announced that shows we’ve tested 97,000 people and that includes, since we’ve been doing the testing, tens of thousands of staff working in care homes and indeed residents as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (32:48);Next we have Laura Hughes from The FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Laura Hughes: (32:52);Hi. Just to follow up on that testing question. I know the numbers have just gone up over the last 24 hours, but it’s actually the sixth day that we’re still not testing at full capacity. Why is that and why are we seeing reports of people saying that it’s taking actually sometimes up to 10 days for them to get their results back, having had a test?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (33:15);Well, I think it’s probably for the reasons that I outlined. And I may ask Steven to come in on this point in a moment, but if you have, as we do, 50 different sites that are offering these drive-through tests, you will get a regional variances. You will have some days where there are surplus tests and people haven’t come forward to take them in some areas, and you’ll have other areas where they don’t have quite enough capacity for that local demand in that particular local area."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (33:44);You’re going to get those day to day fluctuations. I think the important thing is, we set this target to get a 100,000 tests, and we have that capacity. The prime minister’s announced in the last week that we’re going to ramp that up further to 200,000 test capacity per day. That’s going to be important as we start to develop some of our track and trace proposals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (34:08);Testing will be an important element of a part of that. The important thing is to have those ambitious targets that you’re working to, to just continually build the capacity. But you will of course get daily fluctuations in availability in any given local area."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (34:25);Would you like to … Does that answer your question? Or are there any other points?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Laura Hughes: (34:28);If I could ask you a separate question. Would you like to see more fast food outlets like McDonald’s start to reopen? Were you disappointed that a number of fast food retailers actually closed? Do you feel like they could have stayed open safely? And if you do want to encourage them to open up again, what are you doing to ensure they feel that they can do that safely?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (34:50);Well, I have had a number of discussions with some of the food-to-go outlets. Companies such as McDonald’s and KFC and Costa Coffee and so on. It is the case that when we originally did the lockdown, we were quite explicit that it didn’t cover, take away food. While clearly restaurants and pubs had to close, we were quite keen to keep that capacity to be able to do take away food for people and that was clear in the guidance."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (35:19);I think there were a number of reasons why these companies took a decision themselves or their own volition to close. Firstly, footfall in the town centers was obviously down, so where they had branches in town centers, they found that they couldn’t really make them viable. They had issues with anxiety among some of their staff. I think also a sense, that given the strength of the overarching message that people should stay at home, they felt there was maybe a sense that it wasn’t socially acceptable to stay open even though the government hadn’t explicitly mandated their closure."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (35:54);A number of them have in the last two weeks started to consider reopening. Pret a Manger has opened some of its branches. McDonald’s are planning to open a small number of drive-thru venues on a pilot basis. Also, KFC have also, again, on a pilot basis, opened some of their branches. But predominantly for drive-through. I think our view is that probably a McDonald’s drive-through is made for the social distancing situation that we are in. In that people do not leave their car. They place their order and somebody passes a bag of food to them at the end through a kiosk."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (36:38);I think it is quite possible for these venues to reopen and reopen safely. We never mandated that they should close. We’ve learnt a lot from supermarkets and other food outlets about how you can do social distancing and do it well. I think some of those food to go businesses will probably be seeking to learn lessons from what supermarkets have done as they consider tentatively reopening. I think all of them will do this in a cautious way, just as any further evolution in government policy will be cautious."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (37:13);Thank you. We now have Shaun Lintern from The Independent."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Shaun Lintern: (37:18);Good afternoon. A question to you, First Secretary Of State. Sticking with testing. The president of the Institute of Biomedical Science has told The Independent today that the 200,000 test capacity target has not actually been helpful and made it harder for NHS labs to focus testing on the right groups of people. The head of NHS providers said earlier this week that there were problems with key workers getting tests and needing to get back to work. He also called for a more considered strategy. Do you accept that the focus on setting round number targets has not actually been helpful to people in the system? And can you say a bit more about perhaps the strategy that we will need in a more considered testing strategy going forward as we move into test trace and isolate?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Shaun Lintern: (38:09);And to Mr. [inaudible 00:12:08], new figures yesterday showed 600 more care homes have reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in a single week. The total now more than 5,000. So the care sector is clearly the epicenter of the infection. Can you tell us how high the rate of infection in care homes is at the moment and why we’re still sending positive patients into care homes, and what specific steps is the NHS taking to support the sector to look after people infected with COVID-19."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (38:42);Well, on the first point on testing. I don’t think I do accept that. I think it is important and helpful to have targets that you’re moving towards in order to expand that capacity in short order, which is what we’ve been trying to do. That’s why we had that ambitious target to get to 100,000 and again to get to 200,000-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (39:03);… by the end of this month. I don’t really see any reason why those people in the Army who have been heavily involved in the logistics of setting up some of these centers, why the planning to get that additional capacity, both the infrastructure to have additional drive-through testing centers or indeed additional mobile centers and bringing on stream additional laboratory capacity. I don’t really understand at all why that would distract from those that are delivering the current test capacity and they can continue to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (39:38);The planning for an expansion is done by an entirely different set of people. And I think the reason why it is important to have quite an ambitious target, to expand this test capacity further, is as we evolve this policy and as we start to roll out things such as our track and trace approach, testing will become quite an important feature of that. In that, if somebody through the track and trace app reports symptoms and starts to self-isolate, they will also be referred for a test. So if we want to start to roll out some of these smart approaches well, having that test capacity will be quite important. Stephen?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (40:22);Yes. Good afternoon, [inaudible 00:00:40:24]. Of course, it’s really important that we do get on top of outbreaks in care homes, as you suggested. And indeed the NHS has been working increasingly closely with colleagues in social care to provide support. We are testing patients before they are discharged into care homes. But I think it’s important also to note that it’s a relatively small number of discharges from hospitals that actually are directly into care homes, are somewhere in the region of around one in 20 are going into care homes for the first time. We’ve also done some preliminary work on whether there’s any correlation between areas of outbreaks and discharges. And we can’t see a correlation between discharges and outbreaks. It is right though, as I said, that we put as much support as we can possibly do into care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (41:24);That includes support through primary care and general practice, but it also includes support around infection prevention and control. And as you know, hospitals have got very established mechanisms for infection, and prevention, and control through directors of infection, prevention, and control. Typically, the chief nurse of hospitals. And they are lending their expertise to colleagues in the care sector with an offer to help in training and to ensure that the standards of infection control that we are well used to in hospitals is translated as much as possible to assist with infection control in care homes. So you’re absolutely right to point out that the NHS plays a part in supporting colleagues in social care and also public health, because of course the directors of public health in local authorities and local authorities are really key partners as well in managing outbreaks and preventing outbreaks in care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (42:18);[crosstalk 00:42:20]-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Sean: (42:22);If I can just followup a question, then get back to Steve, if I may? Sticking with vulnerable groups. We’ve reported today on new deaths in mental health units, published by the CQC. Why has NHS England not published the data it receives on a weekly basis about the deaths of people from learning disability and autism from COVID-19? Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights, a slew of charities and many parents and families are worried about this lack of transparency from NHS England, especially in what is a traditionally marginalized vulnerable group. Will you commit NHS England to publishing that data and what can you say to reassure families and loved ones?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (43:08);You know, [Sean 00:43:08], that people with learning disabilities and autism and actually wider mental health problems are really key to NHS England’s work, and you know from the longterm plan that we published at the start of last year just quite the focus that we are placing on those groups of individuals. It’s really important that they get the appropriate care, the right care and have parity of care with everybody else, so we’re not losing that focus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Powis: (43:37);In terms of patients with mental health who are unfortunately dying with COVID-19, many of those have been transferred from mental health facilities into acute hospitals. It is a small number, but they are being transferred. And yes, I can commit that we will publish that data. We’ve been looking at how we can do that as part of our … We publish deaths daily. We’re looking at how we can report on those groups and I’ll commit that from next week we will be publishing data on learning disabilities, autism and mental health patients who have died in acute hospitals and we’ll do that at an ongoing basis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (44:19);Thank you very much, Sean. Then finally, we have Stephen Pollard from the Jewish Chronicle."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Pollard: (44:23);Hi. Many people rely on charities for social care and with a huge rise in job losses, those charities which provide administrative support and help with benefits and so on, the demand for them has soared at the very time when their funding has basically stopped. And the one thing you hear consistently from charities is that the government’s package, while welcome, is nothing like big enough. Given that a lot of these charities are providing services that either wouldn’t exist or would cost the taxpayer a fortune if the taxpayer was to provide them, is there any prospect of further funding for charities being considered?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (45:08);Well Stephen, as you alluded to, we have got that fund that was announced, the 750 million pound fund to support a range of charities in a wide range of areas supporting people suffering from the Coronavirus. Indeed, the 16 million pound package that I’ve announced today is being drawn as part of that 750 million pound funding package. There have been many, many successful bids into that covering all of the areas that you’ve mentioned."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (45:41);Also, some of the food charities and many more besides, including packages to support, for instance, smaller zoos and some of the other venues that have been effected. It’s been quite a broad package. I think quite a supportive package. These are extraordinary times, but I think that that 750 million pounds fund is very welcome and has helped a lot of charities with the additional burdens that they have as a result of the Coronavirus. Are there [crosstalk 00:46:11] any other points you want to make as well?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","Stephen Pollard: (46:13);Yeah, just one. One of the most heartbreaking things for many people who’ve lost a loved one to Coronavirus is the restriction on mourners at funerals. Understandable restrictions, but no less heartbreaking for that. I just wondered if there’s any prospect in the relaxation of the easing of some of the rules that the Prime Minister will announce, if mourners may be allowed … Close family mourners may be allowed to attend funerals?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (46:40);Well, I completely understand the point you’re making and this is a very sensitive issue and I also know that because gatherings at places of worship have also been stopped for lots of people from many different religions. That has also affected them as well. But it is funerals, I think, that are the hardest here. We have allowed funerals to continue for immediate family members, close family members, but I appreciate that that’s not much hope for wider family who’d also like to attend. This is an area that we will be looking at closely. Obviously, I can’t prejudge what the Prime Minister might say on Sunday, but I can reassure you that we’re very, very conscious that this is an incredibly sensitive matter, that people want the opportunity to pay their last respects."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-8","George Eustice: (47:36);Obviously, we have to be cautious because we have to be very careful about large social gatherings, but it is something that we are giving consideration to. Right. Thank you very much. That’s the end of the questions that we’ve got today. I would also, again, as I’ve done before, just like to conclude by recording my thanks to all of those working in the food industry, from supermarkets and food manufacturers right through to farmers. There’s really been quite an extraordinary effort over the last couple of months to ensure that we keep food on our supermarket shelves, but thank you all very much."

The UK’s Secretary of State, Robert Jenrick, led the press conference. He said the death toll from COVID-19 has surpassed 30,000 people in Great Britain. Read the full transcript of the speech here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (00:09);Good afternoon and welcome to the coronavirus press conference from Downing Street. I’m joined this afternoon by Professor Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England and Dr. Nikki Kanani, the deputy medical director for NHS England, who has a particular focus on primary care. Today’s data shows that 1,448,010 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out across Great Britain, including 69,463 tests carried out yesterday. 201,101 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 6,111 cases since yesterday. 13,615 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus in Great Britain, down from 13,922 yesterday. Sadly, of those hospitalized with the virus, 30,076 have now died. That’s an increase of 649 fatalities since yesterday. Behind those numbers are heartbreaking losses for the loved ones of all those who’ve died. Once again, our thoughts and our prayers are with their friends and their families."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (01:46);Professor Doyle will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus. But first as community secretary, I’d like to take this opportunity to give an update on the work being done locally during the pandemic to keep people safe, to provide support for people’s jobs and their businesses and to prepare for the reopening and the recovery of our local economies. That’s why it’s appropriate that this afternoon we’re joined by regional journalists who are doing so much to keep people informed about how the national effort is being coordinated in our own communities. A free country needs a free press and the national, the regional and the local newspapers of our country are under significant financial pressure. I’d like to echo the words of the culture secretary recently, in encouraging everyone who can to buy a newspaper. As I said before, the battle against coronavirus will be won in every city, in every town and every village across the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (02:59);This is truly a national effort and it’s a national effort taking place at a local level. My department, the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government has played a vital role in bringing people together to tackle the virus. We’ve provided local authorities with over £3.2 billion during this pandemic so that they can continue to support the communities that need it through this most challenging time, and respond to the immediate pressures they are facing due to coronavirus, whilst also protecting and preserving vital public services. At the start of March, I established a task force to support local resilience forums known as LRFs, standing them up at a local level across the country to prepare each and every community for a range of different scenarios. There are 38 LRFs in England which are made up of emergency services, a range of government agencies, health bodies, and local authorities. They’re headed by some of the most senior and experienced local leaders of the emergency services, of councils, the NHS and others, who together are leading their communities through the crisis with the full support of central government."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (04:21);Recognizing the unprecedented challenge that we faced, I took the decision to embed within them some of the finest military planners in the world from our armed forces, and I’m very grateful for their hard work in recent weeks. This combined expertise and leadership is ensuring a comprehensive, coordinated and consistent response across the country. Responding to the urgent need for personal protective equipment to reach the front line of the care sector, we’ve mobilized LRFs to help distribute PPE and thus far they’ve delivered over 67 million items in England alone since early April. Together with local councils, they’re also assisting us in supporting some of the most vulnerable individuals in their communities and to date they’ve helped us to ensure that one million boxes of food and essential supplies have now been delivered to those people identified by the NHS as extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus, the shielded. With more than 290,000 boxes being distributed every week, this has been a huge team effort and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved for the role that they’ve played and will play in the weeks ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (05:49);We’re also working very closely with mayors to make sure that we have a coordinated approach to tackling coronavirus at a local level. The government has been determined to ensure that the vital work of keeping people safe in their homes also continues. So with the support of the mayors of London, of the Liverpool City Region, of Greater Manchester, of Sheffield, of the West Midlands and others, we were able to announce the building safety pledge. These mayors have come together because they have a number of the high rise buildings with highly flammable cladding in their respective regions. The pledge that we agreed sends a very clear message that vital building safety work must continue despite the coronavirus pandemic. We’ve been joined by 25 local authorities, including 18 in London, who’ve also given their fulsome support. As work on many of these critical sites was paused early on, it’s now slowly starting to resume as a result of this initiative. I would urge any building owner or contractor to do so as soon as practical, where it’s safe, to begin work once again."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (07:12);Now, coronavirus will not stop our mission to level up, to unite and to unleash the potential of this country. The prime minister will set out on Sunday our approach to the second phase of this pandemic. As we look ahead to supporting businesses as they’re able to reopen, my department will lead our work on how our local economies can adapt, evolve, recover and grow. I will continue to support mayors and local government leaders who will play a critical role in this work. Every local economy now needs a plan to restart and recover. We will be informing these plans with our own detailed work in areas such as how workplaces, from factories to construction sites to offices, can be adapted, how outdoor spaces, leisure and businesses, from parks to high streets to markets, can be managed and how public transport networks, from the tube to trams to buses, can operate, in each case guided by scientific and medical advice. We want to ensure appropriate and safe social distancing, providing the public with the confidence to return to work and to return to public spaces and public transport knowing that it’s always safe to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (08:43);We’re considering how we can create more room in town centers for pedestrians, how we can make it easier to cycle or walk to work. We’ll work with towns and places whose economies have been hardest hit, intensively as the recovery begins. Our commitment to infrastructure investment remains undimmed. For example, over two thirds of HS2 sites are open. We want infrastructure and construction work to begin again, wherever it’s safe to do so. It’s clear to everyone that the pandemic is putting huge pressure on economies the world over and there’s no denying the challenges that lie ahead in our own country. But we cannot and will not let this pandemic halt our work to improve connectivity, to provide vital social and cultural infrastructure and to boost economic growth across the regions. That is how we’ll begin to rebuild and to recover from this national emergency. We’re working to ensure the right support is available to local businesses. Last week, High Street businesses began to receive the £22 billion package designed to mitigate some of the effects of coronavirus, with grants of up to £25,000 being paid into bank accounts of those businesses. And of course, our 100 towns benefiting from the £3.6 billion Towns Fund will continue to receive our support and we’ll be working at pace with them in the months ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (10:25);Local authorities have now paid out over £8.6 billion in grants to around 700,000 businesses. As local government secretary, I’d like to congratulate those councils who’ve worked extremely hard, sometimes around the clock, to get those grants out to the businesses that desperately need them. I’d like to congratulate Chichester, Ealing and Hyndburn councils who are the three highest performing councils so far in England. Businesses are also receiving discounts of almost £10 billion on their rates bills in response to COVID-19, with the hardest hit by the pandemic, such as shops, cafes, and pubs, paying no business rates whatsoever this financial year. Together with existing reliefs, this means that 1.1 million rate payers are no longer paying business rates this year."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (11:21);This week, the chancellor and I announced an additional 5% uplift, up to £617 million available to local councils to fund small businesses that rent space in shared offices, industrial units and innovation centers as well as market traders B&Bs that pay council tax rather than business rates, and also to support small charities. Local councils will now have more flexibility to make pragmatic decisions to keep those businesses going so they can bounce back once they’re able to do so. Moving forward, our mission is to ensure everything we can is done to help people to get back to work safely, to reunite friends and family, and to reintroduce the things that make life worth living in a safe way, as soon as it’s safe to do so."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (12:15);Finally, on Friday we will be celebrating as a country the 75th anniversary of VE day. My department, like others, had been helping to plan some of the public celebrations, but we know that, sadly, we’ll now need to mark this important occasion from home instead. Cabinet colleagues have been speaking with veterans organized by the Royal British Legion. I had the pleasure early this week of speaking to Lesley, a 98-year-old World War II veteran on the phone. Lesley was full of warmth and wisdom, telling me how he spent VE day in Sienna having fought his way through North Africa and Italy, and how he would be spending Friday more sedately celebrating at home. He said to me that as we rebuilt and we recovered then, he’s certain that we will do so again this year. I’ll now hand over to Dr. Kanani in the first instance, and then to Professor Doyle. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (13:21);Thank you, Secretary of State. I wanted to just reflect on your points about community and thank communities for following government advice at a incredibly difficult time. I’m a GP and before I was a GP I grew up in a community pharmacy and my colleagues have been facing probably the most challenging time they’ve ever had to. Right across the NHS, people are working under significant stress and strain and our communities have helped to look after them and to look out for them through staying at home and following government advice and becoming volunteer responders and looking out for their own communities. I want to thank you for that. It’s really challenging-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (14:03);… isn’t it? I have a family member who sheltering and homeschooling children and it feels difficult. We all want reassurance and we miss the familiarity of the things that we always used to do."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (14:17);But I wanted to reassure people who are listening and watching today that your primary care services are still there for you. I want to pay tribute to our GP practices and our general practice teams, our dentists, our optometrists, the unsung heroes, the community pharmacists on the high street who have continued to work day after day and make sure that they’re there for you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (14:40);This bank holiday, they’ll be open as well and it might feel a little bit different. You might have more telephone calls or online consultations. You might see somebody dressed in PPE, as I was yesterday in my surgery. But you must know that your NHS is still here for you, so please come and contact us if you need advice or support over the coming weeks and months. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (15:04);Thank you, Nikki. I think we all want to reiterate your comments and the thanks to GPS and everybody working in primary care across the country. I turn over to Yvonne, who’s going to present today’s slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (15:14);Thank you, Secretary of State. So just to remind us all of the five tests for adjusting the lockdown here, we can see that they relate to capacity and to mortality, to death. And also that we are actually controlling the epidemic itself and the transmission of the epidemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (15:33);So looking at the first graph here please, the next slide, we can see again that this is about transport. It’s a regular slide. It shows that overall, transport use is down a good bit, by 50%, but less so for motor vehicles, and that has been slowly increasing over recent weeks. This is up to the 4th of May and it’s for the UK."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (15:55);Could I have the next slide, please? The important message in all that of course is that we must still respect that this virus does transmit and to stay at home and not to interact too much, because people are still very vulnerable to getting this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (16:14);Now we can see here the daily tests and these have increased over time and this is up to the 6th of May. But I will move on, really, to the next slide, which is of interest, which is the new cases. Here we have more new cases and this may be a matter of concern, but of course it’s also a matter of testing more so that we are doing more testing and therefore we will find more cases. This is what we want to do. We want to find the positive cases so that we can break transmission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (16:45);So onto the next one, please. This is about people in hospital. I know of great interest to you listening and the news here is generally very good. You can see where London had its early epidemic and it has declined. The cases in hospital have declined more slowly perhaps, of other regions. We see here where the Northwest has more cases in hospital than London, but overall we have about 13,000 cases, which is a decrease and it’s good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (17:17);Then if we can just look at the most critically ill patients, and this is about critical care beds use throughout the UK. And this is again good news. It’s for the four countries of the UK. And we can see here where we actually have less than a third of critical care beds being occupied by people with the coronavirus. So good news there, it is declining."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (17:40);Then we look at the recorded deaths, less good news here in terms of these are very tragic. It is very, very sad. But the trend is good because it is slowly coming down, and this is a seven day rolling average for the UK. As has been said, we have 649 yesterday and that was a decline, a slow decline."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (18:05);And then, finally, two slides about the international deaths. The first one is just the crude numbers and this, of course, depends on the size of the country. We have over 67,000 deaths in the United States, but, of course, a big country. We can see the UK and the European countries, they’re further down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (18:27);But if we look at the last slide, which is about the rates per million population, then we have taken account of the size of the country, and we can see a different pattern where the UK and European countries are more closely together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (18:43);I want to say that this really is presented just to show you different ways of looking at death. There are many different ways of looking at death. It is far too early to say how this will eventually result, for how countries have fared in this epidemic. We need to give this some time. Most of those who are used to looking at these things would say probably a year, but we thought you would be interested to see. So thank, you Secretary of State."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (19:11);Well, thank you very much, Yvonne. Before we turn to questions from the regional press, we have two from members of the public and the first one is from Edward in Harrogate."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Edward: (19:21);Given the excess in critical care beds across the NHS and Nightingale Hospitals, my question is why has the UK suffered a greater number of deaths when compared to countries such as Italy who had their healthcare systems completely overrun by COVID-19?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (19:39);Well, thank you, Edward, for that question: Why has the UK suffered a higher number of deaths compared to Italy, for example, whose healthcare system was overrun by COVID-19? Well, I think as the prime minister has said on a number of occasions now, it is difficult to make international comparisons with certainty today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (19:58);There will be a time for that and we have already established the way in which we will measure that in due course, which is a measure of excess deaths. But that is a hard calculation to do with accuracy today. Of course we want to learn whatever lessons we can do whilst we’re still responding to the virus, but I think the time for accurate international comparisons will come in the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (20:21);It is more positive, of course, that when we saw those very disturbing scenes earlier in the year in Italy of their very good health service being overwhelmed and were concerned about the potential impact upon the NHS, that we haven’t seen those scenes in the UK. We have had sufficient ICU capacity. We have had sufficient ventilator capacity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (20:43);Of course, we’ve been able to build capacity for example with the Nightingale Hospitals, some of which have not been used at all so far during the course of the virus. And if Yvonne, you want to add more about the international perspective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (20:57);Thank you, Secretary of State. So credit to the NHS for not being overwhelmed. But international comparisons as I have mentioned, countries, Edward, measure in very different ways. They measure this virus number of deaths in different ways and that is absolutely fine so long as that is consistent in each country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (21:19);It makes international comparisons very difficult, though, because we are not comparing like with like. It’s worth continuing to stress this, because over time probably the right measures have been outlined by a number of our experts, including our chief medical officer, which would be excess mortality, excess deaths overall in a period of time and then we will know truly how we have been impacted. But also this is a comparable measure internationally, so we would then be able to understand how we have been impacted internationally as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (21:55);Thank you very much. Well, our second question is from Emma from Swansea. Emma’s question is: Religion is a huge part of life for many in the UK. Seeing sport prioritized in discussions over other parts of life has been hard to see. How will the government protect the rights of religious communities to practice their faith in community as the lockdown is eased?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (22:21);Well, that’s a very important question. Obviously, in any part of our lives, the government has been driven by a desire to protect life and has taken expert medical and scientific opinion. But we’re very aware that this has been a difficult period for different faith groups."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (22:39);You’ve seen, for example, the Jewish community having to hold their Seders at Passover by Zoom and without having their friends and family around them. You then saw the same at Easter, where churches were not able to come together and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Cardinal Nichols and others held their sermons and services over the internet, as in churches across the country. And then at the moment through Ramadan, friends and family not able to come together to break fast in the way that they traditionally would."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (23:11);We know this is very tough and none of us would want these restrictions to continue a day longer than they need to. But it is right that we stick to the medical advice at this time, however much it goes against our traditions and our religious beliefs in order to protect others as well as ourselves."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (23:31);We are in conversation with faith leaders across the country to consider how when the time is right, they will be able to recommence services in churches and mosques and synagogues across the country. But that moment is not now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (23:47);We’re also been working with them on how we can ensure that funerals and other important events in people’s lives are conducted in an appropriate way. My department has issued guidance to enable people to hold funerals in public spaces."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (24:04);For example, like crematoriums with close members of their family around them, because none of us want to see scenes, which we did see unfortunately in a small number of occasions early on in the virus, of funerals being conducted with few if anyone present."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (24:21);That wasn’t right. We’ve issued guidance now so that shouldn’t happen again, and we’re working with faith leaders to see how where appropriate those funerals can be conducted in churches or other settings like that as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (24:34);I don’t know if Yvonne or Nikki, you want to add anything to that from your perspectives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (24:36);Well, I think, as you said, it’s important that we work with our communities. We also know that we’ve seen a difference in how different communities have had COVID-19 infections as well. So there’s a lot that we can do to understand how our communities are responding and making sure that communities have what they need during the coming weeks and months."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (24:58);And Secretary of State, could I just cite my thanks to the various religious leaders that have worked with Public Health England and with the NHS to handle very sensitive issues in a very helpful, proactive way. Understanding how very difficult this is for the communities in terms of handling the host, in terms of group gatherings and then, sadly, in terms of funerals and respectful handling of bodies, we have worked very constructively. And for that, I am very grateful."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (25:35);Absolutely. Thank you. Well, thank you, Emma for that question. Our first question from members of the press comes from Patrick Burns from BBC West Midlands. Good afternoon, Patrick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (25:46);Good afternoon, Secretary of State. I’m sure you don’t need me to remind you that at the beginning of all this, the prime minister pledged to local authority leaders that they would have a key role, the lead role, in bringing their local communities and vulnerable people through all this. “Resources will follow,” he said."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (26:04);Well, six weeks on, it’s beginning to look as though even the extra help that you’ve been talking about just now may not actually be enough. If you think of Birmingham City Council alone, the extra costs they’ve incurred already as a result of this heading north of 260 million pounds and counting and they’re leader in wards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (26:26);There’s the really crucial services like adults’ social care and children’s services may be compromised in the near future if, as he puts it, the government doesn’t match its words with action."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (26:41);Well, thank you. Well, let me be very clear to local council leaders across the country, including in the West Midlands. We will stand behind them, ensure that they have the resources that they need to carry out the absolutely critical functions that they’re playing in our national response to coronavirus. That was the promise that I made to local council leaders, as did the prime minister early in the life of the emergency."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (27:05);We’ve already provided 3.2 billion pounds of additional resources to councils in just the last two months. We’ve provided almost 4 billion pounds of cashflow to councils, precisely so that they shouldn’t have to face the difficult choices that you’ve just described: between responding to the virus in their own communities and continuing to do very important public service functions like refuse collection, for example, looking after vulnerable children in their communities."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (27:36);In the West Midlands, local councils will receive 347 million pounds to deal with the pressures of coronavirus. That comes on top of a very generous settlement at the beginning of the financial year, which also increased their core spending power by over 300 million pounds."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (27:55);If further resources are required to meet the COVID-related costs that we’ve asked councils to bear, then obviously we’ll take that-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (28:03);… into consideration in the future. And I’ve been working very closely with local council leaders and the mayor in the West Midlands, Andy Street, who’s been doing a fantastic job at leading the community forward through a very difficult time. I don’t know there’s anything further you’d like to ask, Patrick, or move on to the next question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Patrick West: (28:24);I just like to really sort of suggest that the key issue here, Secretary of State, is making sure that the extra support gets through to all the authorities who need it. If you take Shropshire as an example, they say the money that they’ve received doesn’t yet cover all the extra costs that they have incurred. And within that area, if you talk to Shrewsbury Town Council, they’ve been saying on the BBC Radio Shropshire that not enough of the money is actually filtering down to the lower tier authorities like them, who, as they point out are, actually closest to the very communities that most need the help."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (28:59);Well, there’s two points there. Firstly, in terms of ensuring that councils get the resources they need, we’re absolutely committed to doing that. Councils are receiving more money so far than they have reported to us as needing to meet the COVID related costs that they’re bearing. They are also, like other organizations across the country, seeing significant reductions in their income because we’re not parking in their car parks and using their leisure centers and so on. And that’s a particular challenge that we’re also focused on. But that’s a separate issue. In the latest 1.6 billion pounds that we provided to councils, we made sure that a significant amount of it did flow to lower tier councils, like district councils for example. And so your average district council in England will now receive, if they haven’t done so already in the coming days, a million pounds or more of additional grant to help them with COVID related expenditure and also to stabilize their finances."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (29:58);And we’ve asked big parish councils, like the ones that you’ve referred to in Shropshire like Shrewsbury or Bridgnorth or Ludlow, to speak with their principal councils, who will be receiving that million pounds or more of funding, and ensure that it flows down to them if they’re also under financial pressure at the moment. And I hope that that will help. Obviously, my department and I are here to speak with those councils and ensure they get through this with us together. Thank you, Patrick. I’ll come to the second question now, which is from James Vincent from BBC Yorkshire. Good afternoon, James."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","James Vincent: (30:33);Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I’m on BBC Look North tonight. We’ve gone out. We’re been speaking to Sarah, who’s a six-year-old from Tadcaster who needs a kidney transplant. Her operation was canceled when the coronavirus crisis hit. What works are the government and the NHS doing to make sure that those people that need vital care, vital operations away from coronavirus, are going to get that as soon as possible? And what’s the NHS and the government doing to make sure that any backlog is worked through in the best possible way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (31:02);Thank you, James. And that’s a very important question, which I’m sure is on the mind of many people across the country. Can I perhaps come to Nikki in the first instance?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (31:08);[crosstalk 00:03:09], thank you for your question, and it’s something that we’re thinking about very actively as you can imagine. I think it was right that over the last few weeks and months, the NHS made a concerted effort to focus on services that were either urgent for an individual or were related to the COVID response. And we absolutely had to do that, so we had to step away from other procedures and routine reviews that we might have otherwise done. But now, and as Simon Stevens wrote last week, we’ve asked the whole system to start to think about how to get back to what we call normal services. And there will be some things that we want to keep. So during the pandemic, actually, services have revolutionized the way that they’ve worked, whether that’s by using digital technology or developing new ways of caring for patients. But in the case of the child that you mentioned, that that child will be prioritized and that operation will be scheduled so that we can get people back on track and that the really important things happen as soon as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (32:11);Very good. Thank you. Do you have a followup question, James?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","James Vincent: (32:13);[crosstalk 00:32:13] to her quick followup on council finances. Are councils in Yorkshire saying that there’s a 200 million pound gap between what you’re providing and what they think they’ll be spending on the coronavirus crisis? On Monday, you told MPs that some of those calculations from councils were highly speculative. Are you suggesting that they’re perhaps getting their sums wrong?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (32:35);No, not at all. We’ve provided, as I said, 3.2 billion pounds to councils already plus 4 billion pounds of cashflow, so it’s a lot of money to be provided in just a two month period to councils. And we think that is sufficient to meet the immediate demands of the crisis. However, as we understand better the length at which locked down measures may have to be in place and the economic disruption that flows as a result of the crisis, which is difficult to judge today, we will work with councils to ensure that they have the funding that is required so they can navigate their way through this difficult period."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (33:13);So my message to councils is continue to do the important work that you’re doing, whether that’s on adult social care, getting rough sleepers off the streets, supporting the vulnerable, getting those business grants out to the community. And we’ll make sure that you have the funding that’s required, and we’ll work with you to better understand, in the weeks and months ahead, the true impact upon your finances of the disruption economically that we’re suffering and of their response to coronavirus. It’s too early to tell in some cases what those costs will be. But we will learn in the weeks and months to come, and we’ll work very closely with councils, including throughout Yorkshire. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (33:53);The next question is from Tom Sheldrick, who is from ITV Tyne Tees. Tom."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Tom Sheldrick: (33:58);Thank you. Good afternoon. Last week our analysis revealed that the Northeast has had a higher number of confirmed coronavirus cases per head than any other parts of England and the gap is continuing to widen. The virus is affecting some of the most deprived areas in our region particularly badly. The regional chair of the British Medical Association, Dr. George Ray, has called for the government to act on health inequalities, which he describes as a point of national shame. So what are you doing now to try to reduce the number of people in the Northeast being infected with coronavirus? And going forward, how will you address longterm issues, which mean that people in our region are less likely to be in good health and at greater risk from viruses like this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (34:42);Thank you, Tom. Well, I’ll ask Yvonne to speak in a moment to the main part of your question. But on the broader issue of emerging data, suggesting the socioeconomic impact upon deaths with the virus, obviously that’s extremely concerning to us. We want to understand all of the contributing factors that make people more vulnerable to the virus, including those and including, for example, some of the ethnic groups like the BAME communities, and their exposure to the virus. We’re working with Public Health England, and on some of those issues, like for example the BAME issue, the chief medical officer’s commissioned specific research so we can better understand the issue and respond to it in due course. But Yvonne, I don’t know if you want to say more in particular about the Northeast and its position in the passage of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (35:33);Yes. Thank you, Secretary of State. So, Tom, there are over 8,000 confirmed positive cases of coronavirus in the Northeast at the moment, and, as you see, some areas of great need, which of course we would have been involved with, both from our national through to local services in the public health system before this epidemic. What we really need to know now, first, is to understand what additional or excess impact this virus has had on those communities and how distributed that might be. So as well as doing work generally on disadvantaged in particular groups in the population, we would like to look at the geographies that have been most impacted by that. And that work is underway, and we will be able to describe that as we go forward over the coming weeks and months."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (36:26);But also, I would want to reassure you that the business as usual work needs to continue in working locally to promote the good health of people and to ensure that we are protecting their health from issues other than COVID because one of the great dangerous here is that people forget that actually there are other harms in the population, some of which may be greater than the virus itself. So our local team’s working with local councils and particularly local public health departments. Directors of public health are very active. We’re in touch every week and sometimes several times a week to understand the dynamics of what is going on and to make sure that the good business as usual, as far as it can, can continue. And just one concern is, of course, that if our services have how to stop, for instance, immunization or smoking cessation that we actually move as soon as we can when it’s safe to reestablish the preventive services as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (37:31);Thank you. Tom, do you have a quick followup to that question, or are you content?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Tom Sheldrick: (37:35);Yes, please. If I can ask you, Secretary of State, are you considering lifting lockdown restrictions later in regions like the Northeast where the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow while it’s perhaps stabilizing elsewhere?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (37:47);Well, the Prime Minister will set out on Sunday our approach to the next phase of the virus. So I don’t think that I can helpfully presage those remarks. Our strong preference, though, is that the whole country moves as one, but if, as we build up our infrastructure for testing and tracking and tracing, in time it’s required for us to make interventions in smaller sort of micro communities where you’re seeing the virus take hold again, then that will be something that we consider as other countries around the world have done when they’ve implemented effective track and trace systems. But that’s quite different to making major changes to lockdown measures in one part of the country versus another and our strong preference, as it was at the beginning of the lockdown measures, is for the whole country to move as one. I’ll go now to the next question, which is from Zena Hawley from the Derby Telegraph. Zena"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (38:48);Thank you, Mr. Jenrick. I wanted to say that Derby is a great city with a strong industrial base, but the announcement of 8,000 potential job losses at Rolls-Royce could have extreme consequences, obviously for the company, but also for the supply chain of the companies that obviously supply it. What can the government do to help Rolls-Royce, a company that’s always been there for Britain through times of extreme hardship, et cetera? And also, could ask more widely what role does the government expect cities like Derby to play as we emerge from the current crisis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (39:24);Well, thank you very much, and I share your concern for the news of potential job losses at Rolls-Royce. I know how important Rolls-Royce is to Derby, to the Midlands and to the whole country. It’s one of our most important advanced manufacturing business, one with a very rich history, and I’m certain a business that will have a great future as well. It’s renowned all over the world. Aviation is an important sector to the economy, but it is a sector facing almost unprecedented issues as a result of coronavirus. We want to support the aviation sector in any way that we can do. The Chancellor has already announced an unprecedented set of measures to support businesses large and small. I know that Rolls-Royce is a business that has already taken advantage, for example, of the Job Retention Scheme, furloughing some of its employees from April."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (40:24);We’re going to work closely with the sector, and we’ve said before that we’re willing to consider situations where we would support individual firms, but obviously only when they’ve worked through the existing government schemes and other ways in which they might be able to raise finance commercially or through existing shareholders. If there’s more we can do for Rolls-Royce, we want to do so, and I know that the Business Secretary and the Chancellor are already in contact with Rolls-Royce and will do so again in the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (40:57);As regards Derby more generally, well, it’s one of our great cities, a city I know well representing a Nottinghamshire constituency nearby. I’m certain it has a strong future. I will be working closely with local leaders to ensure that their plans for rebuilding and recovering the local economy work in step with those that we’re producing nationally and the voice of the business community in Derby is heard in the decisions that we’re making here in Whitehall. And that’s the same for cities, for local government leaders and for mayors across the country. Thank you very much. Was there a further question you’d like to add, or are you content with that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (41:34);If I could, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (41:34);Absolutely."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (41:35);I want to talk about education because that’s something that’s dear to my heart as the education correspondent at the Derby Telegraph. Schools and their plans for reopening. I’ve had discussions with local unions. I’ve had discussions with local experts in the education field. And there is a strong feeling that it’s going to be very, very difficult to achieve very easily, and I’m wondering whether or not there is going to be any move towards having PPE in schools at all?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Zena Hawley: (42:03);So far, teachers have been going into school, they’ve been there for key workers’ children, they’ve carried on. And I know there’s been quite a bit of illness among teachers, but what can we do to protect our teachers and actually give confidence to parents, staff, and pupils that could be going back to school any time?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (42:24);Thank you. Well, I know that there will be concern from teachers, as [inaudible 00:42:28] parents and the education sector have been working closely with the trade unions and other representatives from education to plan a phased reopening of schools when the time is right. We have taken scientific advice with respect to the level of PPE that might be required in schools, and I’ll let Yvonne speak to that perhaps in a moment, who’s better placed than I will. But as I understand it, the advice is that staff in non-residential education settings don’t require PPE, but we will obviously keep that under close review. And we’ve also published guidance on social distancing within schools, which is already being applied in the schools that are open, obviously only with a small percentage of students currently in them, but which will inform the plans that are emerging for the reopening of schools when the time’s right. And if Yvonne’s, there’s anything you’d like to add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (43:22);So [inaudible 00:01:21], yes. Getting the confidence of parents and teachers will be critical actually, as to whether the children would come back to school even if it was agreed that they should. And what can be done there is part of a package. It’s very important that… You’re probably thinking about PPE like face masks. Now face masks, there’s been a lot of debate about that. They are probably helpful to protect others from yourself when you’re not well, particularly if you’re exuding droplets, coughing and sneezing and so on, but they have to be worn properly. And people always forget that face masks are not actually what is going to contain the virus, wholly. It is a whole package of issues like good hygiene, particularly hand hygiene, how you interact your hand with your face and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (44:13);And equally, how the school environment is kept clean, disinfected, how the children are spaced, and this will all take quite a lot of organization. So, this is why no one is rushing to do this prematurely. And we have looked at what other countries are doing on this so that we’re learning about how countries have gained the confidence of parents and teachers. Teachers are key workers, and if they’re unwell they can have testing, and they should do that and indeed should not work if they’re unwell. So, there is good guidance. We in Public Health England and others are working with the Department for Education intensely on this, and with indeed the trades unions and others in those conversations so that we try to get this right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (45:00);Thank you, very helpful. Welcome to the next question now, which is from Keith Rossiter, and Keith is from Cornwall Live and the Western Morning News. Good afternoon Keith."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Keith Rossiter: (45:11);Good afternoon secretary of state. Well, thanks for encouraging your viewers to go out and buy a copy of the newspaper. Cornwall relies heavily on tourism and the hospitality industry, and our hoteliers, publicans and resorts fear that they could lose a whole year if they don’t reopen by July. If that happens, what will the government do to support them?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (45:40);Thank you. Well, I think we all understand that many businesses across the country are suffering, but those in hospitality are particularly poorly equipped to cope with what’s happening at the moment. And an economy such as the Southwest, which is so heavily dependent on tourism, will be very significantly impacted. The package of measures that the chancellor has already brought forward are helping businesses in Cornwall. I think Southwest councils will receive over one and a half billion pounds of business support, and there’s 126,000 businesses within the Southwest who are eligible for those grants."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (46:19);I know that Cornwall council is one of the best in the country for getting those grants out to the businesses who really need them. They’ve already paid out 202 million pounds worth of grants to 17,789 firms, which is one of the highest in England, and I pay tribute to the officers at Cornwall Council for doing that. The prime minister has said today that if further interventions are required to support a sector like tourism or hospitality, we will obviously consider that and bring forward appropriate measures when they’re needed. We know that it’s going to be very difficult for them in the months to come, and we want to try to guide their path through this period so that they, like the rest of the economy, can bounce back when we’re able to reopen in due course. Keith, I don’t know if you have a second question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Keith Rossiter: (47:16);Yes I do. Thank you. Sir Patrick Vallance, earlier in the week, suggested or hinted that some regions could come out of lockdown sooner, and we saw from one of the slides earlier that the Southwest has the lowest number of cases. If we were released sooner, what support would there be for Devon and Cornwall police, who are already very overstretched, to prevent a large scale invasion of holiday makers?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (47:53);Well, I’ll pass it on to Yvonne to speak about the regional disparities in the path of the virus and how we might respond to that, including through tracking and tracing. In terms of local councils and the emergency services and ensuring that they have the support that’s required, as I said earlier, we’re providing additional funding to forces and the home secretary is speaking with national police chiefs to ensure that they have the right guidance and consistent messaging that they can use to enforce the lockdown rules where that’s required. And as we’ve seen so far, the vast majority of members of the public have chosen to do so and to adhere to the messaging. And most police forces have been able to support the lockdown measures through consent, which is the way we want to do things in this country. But in the isolated number of cases where that’s not been possible, obviously they’ve also had tools at their disposal to find and to enforce the lockdown. Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (48:57);So, thank you [inaudible 00:48:58] secretary of state. So Keith, there are over 14,000 confirmed cases in Cornwall. Saying that, it’s a big county, so actually the epidemic seems to have had somewhat less impact in the Southwest, and we need to be absolutely sure that it stays that way. So, we’re watching it very carefully and hopefully it will. Now if and when restrictions ease on the way people are living lives at the moment, it would be very important that we don’t begin to see the reemergence of transmission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Yvonne Doyle: (49:37);And what secretary of state has been describing is this major program that we are actually trialing at the moment through the use of an app in the Isle of Wight but will be much broader than that. It will be really a population based program to ensure that people who are unwell, particularly with the symptoms of this virus, are isolated pretty quickly and tested quickly and that their contacts, particularly their immediate contacts, the ones that matter are also informed and can take action. And that will absolutely be key to gradually releasing life back to a changed normal. And that program is being launched this month, and it’s very important that we’re confident that works well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (50:22);Thank you. And thank you, Keith, for your questions. If I may now go to the last question, which is from Chris Young. And Chris is the local democracy reporter based at the Telegraph and Argus in Bradford. Good afternoon, Chris."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Chris Young: (50:38);Good afternoon. The past few weeks there’s been many student nurses, paramedics, midwives called to the front line of the NHS to help with the current pandemic, and many of them in Bradford. Now due to changes made a couple of years ago by government, the current cohort, final year student nurses are having to pay their fees without the support of bursaries. And effectively, they’re having to risk their lives and use loans to pay to do that. Do you think it’s fair that these student nurses who are stepping up to help the NHS are having to get into that and risk the lives and then facing this mountain of debt afterwards? And would you support any campaign by the Telegraph and Argus and other local news organizations to have this scrapped, their tuition fees scrapped once this is all done?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (51:33);Well, thank you Chris and thank you for all the work that the Telegraph and Argus does in Bradford supporting the NHS, including those healthcare professionals who’ve chosen to come back to work in the service and who have done a fantastic job already, and many are still returning to work in the NHS and in social care. We’re very grateful for nursing and midwifery students who have chosen to go on to the frontline and help in our hospitals and care homes at this time. Those nurses and midwives who have opted in will receive the salary and the pension that is appropriate to their level. And I’m also told that the student loan company have confirmed that student loans will continue regardless of whether the individual is learning or whether, as in this case, they’ve chosen to opt in and help us in the NHS. But we’re all, I think just massively grateful for those people, for everything that they’re doing on the front line. I don’t know if Nicky, you want say anything more about the [crosstalk 00:52:39]"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Dr. Nikki Kanani: (52:39);Yes, absolutely. Thank you, secretary of state. I would just echo your thanks, first of all. We’ve seen an incredible number of not just our students coming to work at a really challenging time across all the professions, but a huge number of staff coming back. So people who’ve retired or who’ve left the NHS thinking that they want to come back and work with us and support our patients. So, I’m incredibly grateful to them. We hope that some of those people who’ve returned will want to stay with us as well. So, we’re looking now to create different ways of working so that those members of staff who’ve come back and joined us can stay working with us. And that could be different ways, so digitally, remotely, working with our local practices in the case of primary care. But we really do thank them, and we really value the time that they’ve given us at a very challenging time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (53:29);Great. Thank you. Chris, is there a follow up you’d like to ask?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Chris Young: (53:33);I had just one last question. It seems like a long time ago now, but early March the government announced in the budget, a lot of support for Yorkshire and Bradford devolution and a huge amount of funding. Obviously a lot has changed since then. A lot of this funding we’re seeing is vital to help areas like Bradford regenerate. With all its change, can there be any guarantee that all these projects, this funding devolution is still going to be there or are places like Bradford back to the drawing board after this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (54:08);Well, thank you. That’s a very important question to end this afternoon’s press conference. This government was elected on a platform of leveling up and uniting the whole country, and we have absolutely no intention of stalling those plans. And in fact, unfortunately some of those places that we were already focused on, already working with, are exactly the sorts of communities and economies that are likely to be most hit by the economic disruption that’s going to come out of Coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-6","Robert Jenrick: (54:41);And so it is extremely important that we return with gusto to that agenda, and that’s absolutely what we intend to do. We will continue to devolve power to local communities in Yorkshire. As you know, at the budget, we signed a fantastic new devolution deal for leads and its surrounding economy, and we want to do more for North Yorkshire, for the Humber, and [inaudible 00:55:08] for other parts of the North of England as well. We’ll return to our work on towns, ensuring that they get the funding that they need for technology, for education and skills and infrastructure. And that work will be more important than ever as we begin to rebuild and recover the economy and move forward with the life of the country. Thank you very much, Chris. Much appreciated. And that concludes this afternoon’s press conference. Thank you very much indeed for joining us from Downing Street today."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","British officials gave a coronavirus briefing on April 28. Matt Hancock led this briefing. Full transcript is here."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (00:00);And by deputy chief scientific advisor, Angela McLean. This morning at 11:00 o’clock, we paused to remember the 85 NHS colleagues and the 19 colleagues from social care who’ve lost their lives with coronavirus. It was a solemn moment of reflection for so many of us, and of unbearable sadness for some. These are the nation’s fallen heroes and we will remember them. Every day we’re working through our plan to protect life and to protect the NHS, slowing the spread and building capacity so that the NHS, at all times, can offer the very best care to everybody because we’ve got the beds and the ventilators and the staff available."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (00:53);So far, thanks to the incredible work of NHS colleagues and the shared sacrifice of everyone who’s at home, that plan is working. The latest figure show 3,260 spare critical care beds across the NHS. On the most recent figures, there’ve been 763,387 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 43,453 yesterday. 161, 145 people have tested positive, an increase of 3,996. 15,796 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. 21,678 have now sadly died in hospital, an increase of 586 since yesterday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (01:54);This morning, the office for national statistics and the CQC published more information on the overall impact, including that there have been 4,343 notified deaths in care homes since Easter. The proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is around a sixth of the total, which is just below what we see in normal times. I want to make sure that we bring as much transparency as possible to important information like this. And so from tomorrow, we’ll be publishing not just the number of deaths in hospital each day, but the number of deaths in care homes and in the community too. This is something that wasn’t previously possible. This will supplement the ONS and CQC weekly publication and all add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day, and it’ll help inform the judgements that we make as we work to keep people safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (02:59);Behind every single death is a family’s heartbreak, and we must do everything humanly possible to save as many lives as we can. We will not be changing the social distancing rules until our five tests have been met, the NHS protected, infection rates falling, the number of deaths falling substantially, the operational challenges around testing and PPE addressed and no risk of a second spike."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (03:32);I want to update you on two other issues of major importance. First on testing. At the start of the month, I set a goal of 100,000 tests a day. Every day, we’re ramping up this testing capacity on track to meet that goal. We’re continuously opening new drive-through centers. There are now 41 with 48 going live this week. For people who can’t get to the tests, we’re expanding home testing to bring the test to them. We’re increasing the dispatch of home test kits from 5,000 a day last Friday to 25,000 a day by the end of the week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (04:12);At the weekend, 17 mobile testing units, manned by the army, were operational. By the end of the week, we plan to have over 70 deployed with trained crews right across the country. All of this has led to an increase in daily testing capacity, which now stands at 73,400, and this has allowed us progressively to expand access to testing. We started with hospital patients who’ve always have the access to tests right away through ramping up to include symptomatic NHS and social care colleagues and their households and then to all essential workers. Today, because we’ve been able to expand capacity, I can expand access further."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (05:04);Building on successful pilots, we’ll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS. This will mean that anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test whether they have symptoms or not. I’m determined to do everything I can to protect the most vulnerable and we now have the capacity to go further still. So from now, we’re making testing available to all over 65s and their households with symptoms and to all workers who would have to leave home in order to go to work and members of their households, again, who have symptoms. So from construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing. The expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe and it’s possible because we’ve expanded capacity for testing thus far."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (06:20);Next, I want to update you on our COVID-19 therapeutics work. This is research to understand whether existing drugs could be used to treat people more effectively once they’ve developed the disease. Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat COVID-19, but our therapeutics task force has identified a number of promising candidates. Currently, six different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials, and the first is ready to enter the next stage, a new early phase clinical trial platform that we’re launching today. This is a national effort made possible by government, academia, and industry all working together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (07:01);In addition, we have to make the best possible use of all the medicines that we have. We’re updating the guidelines for the use of medicines in care homes, removing a barrier so that for the period of the pandemic, where it’s clinically appropriate, medicines that have been labeled for use by one patient can be used by another patient who needs them instead of being destroyed. Clinicians and colleagues in social care have called for this change and it’s already standard procedure in hospitals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (07:32);Right across government, we’re working day and night to defeat this virus, ramping up testing capacity, investigating new drugs and treatments, backing vaccine development, securing and distributing billions of items of PPE, getting the NHS whatever resources it needs to make sure that it is always there to treat everybody who needs it. The risk of a second peak is real, but as a nation, we’re holding it at bay. So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’m now going to turn to the deputy chief scientific advisor to take us through the daily charts. Angela."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (08:15);Thank you very much. If I could have the first slide please. I wanted to go into a bit more detail about the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. So the first of those is that the NHS shall have sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The second is that we should have seen a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from coronavirus. Number three says that we must have reliable data to show us that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. Fourth is that operational challenges, including testing and PPE, are in hand with supply able to meet future demand. And the fifth test is that we must be confident that any adjustments that we make to our current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (09:23);And if I could just have the next slide please, here is a description of transport use and how it has changed across Great Britain for a number of different ways of traveling. And it starts on the 16th of March on the left hand side and runs to Saturday, 26th of April. And what you see when you look at this data is how volumes of all kinds of traffic have fallen relative to how much travel there was in the first week of February. So in particular, we remain pleased to see that the use of public transport is below 20% for buses, the tube and national rail. And we just very much hope that all those people in motor vehicles who are not below 20% are practicing really excellent social distancing when they get it wherever it is that they’re going."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (10:22);Next slide please. We know that it’s been a lot of work for everybody, and this slide is new cases in UK between the 21st of March and the 28th of April. And what it shows is that that … So this is new positive tests. In dark blue is tests that happened in hospitals and in orange is additional testing that has become available for key workers. And what you see in that slide is how that number of positive tests rose very quickly through the latter part of March and has now stabilized. And the blue line, the numbers in hospital positive tests, is starting to fall, although because of the number of tests is still rising overall, we’re still getting about the same number of positive tests across the UK. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (11:26);This instead of counting test counts people. So this is people who are in hospital with COVID-19 again across the UK. And what you see is that overall, that has fallen by 14% in the last … I think it’s in the last week. Sorry, I’m looking for a date. It’s yes. Over the last week, that has fallen by 14%, particularly a dramatic fall in [inaudible 00:11:55] peaked early compared with the rest of the country, and several other regions of England now are clearly falling, although a few regions of England, that number of people in hospital, is still stable for now. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (12:15);This is critical care beds in which there is a patient with COVID-19. So this is two kinds of critical care beds, those in the high dependency wards and those in intensive care wards. And the four different lines are England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. And what you see is what percentage of those beds that can be used for critical care are occupied by a patient with COVID-19. Again, what you see is across all four nations, that has peaked and is beginning to fall as a percentage. Next slide please. We have to turn to how many people have died from COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (13:03);We have to turn to how many people have died from COVID. And our first way of counting that is daily COVID-19 deaths in hospital. So this is a slide that many of us would be familiar with. It’s the way we have been counting for more than a month now. When you look at that slide, the first thing you see is this, well, I guess the first thing you see is that the number of deaths in hospital has started to fall. It’s been falling for the last two weeks. You see that most easily by looking at the orange line. The orange line is a seven day rolling average. And the reason we use that is that there are these very strong weekend effects in these data. So what you see is that out of every seven days, there are always two days when it’s really low, followed by a day when it’s much higher. Because today is Tuesday, it’s higher today. Because on a Tuesday, we report results from a few days ago. I think the most important thing to see there is that the orange line is falling steadily. But this is just one of the ways that we can count how many people have died with COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (14:11);Next slide please. This is a different way of counting the same thing. So this is all weekly registered deaths from COVID-19 across the UK compared with what I just showed you, the deaths in hospital. So let’s just look at the last bar, which is for the week leading up to the 17th of April. The dark blue bar is what we just looked at but summed up up to then. Whereas the pale blue bar is all weekly registered deaths. So that’s everybody, not just the people who died with COVID in hospital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (14:47);If I could have the next slide, please. So what the next slide does is it takes the pale blue line that we just had and breaks it out into a number of different locations. So what you see is hospital is the right hand bar in a sort of smoky blue. Just the left of that is people who died with COVID in care homes. Just below that is people who died with COVID in their own home. And then the smallest bar is other locations. So what you can see here is that deaths from COVID are dominated by those deaths in hospital, but that is not the only location in which such deaths are seen. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (15:41);The last slide for today compares UK deaths with those in other nations. So these lines are lined up against the first day when there had been a total of 50 deaths accumulated in each of these nations. And we have two different lines on there describing what’s happened in the UK. Towards the right hand side, you see a dark blue line labeled UK hospitals only. And that’s the data that we’ve been collecting and showing for a long time. So it’s people who have died with COVID in UK hospitals. Whereas a gray line further over to the left there is people who have died with COVID in the UK in all settings. And not surprisingly, if you count all settings, that line is higher than the people who died in UK hospitals. That’s the end of the data for today. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (16:39);Thanks very much, indeed. As with yesterday. We’re now going to take questions from the public before turning to journalists. And the first, we’re going to take two questions today from the public. These are questions that, as with the questions from journalists, we don’t see an advance. The first I’ll read out from the screen and then the second is going to be relayed by video. So the first question is from Amanda from Hull and she asks, given that grandparents can not be used as childcare, what is the plan for easing the lockdown for full time working parents who have young children that may not be allowed to be in school on a full time basis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (17:23);And Amanda, this is a really good question. And the honest answer I can give you is that it is still too early to say when we’re going to be able to get schools to go back because there are still too many deaths each day. And the five tests that we set out haven’t been met. Now I know, especially as a father of three young children, that there’s a yearning from people to know when schools might go back. And of course it’s something that we think about and we talk about. And I’m sorry that I can’t give you a more definitive answer, but I can’t because we don’t yet have the number of deaths and the number of infections low enough for that to be safe to reopen the schools and we don’t yet know how fast the number of new cases will fall. And so we haven’t been able to make that decision yet. Angela, I don’t know if you want to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (18:29);I’m not sure I do have anything to add on that. We are, of course, all of us, yearning for the number of deaths each day to fall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (18:38);Thank you, Amanda. Thank you for your question. And all I can say is that I hope we can be in a position to be able to give a definitive answer as soon as possible. And the best way to get there is for people, everybody watching, to stay at home in order to protect the NHS, to save lives, and to bring that curve down. Thank you, Amanda. Next question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Sadie: (19:03);Hi. My question is regarding my 10 year old son who has cystic fibrosis and autism. Apart from shielding, is there any other option for him and others in the extremely vulnerable category to return to school and be part of society again without a vaccine available?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (19:20);Thank you, Sadie. The answer to this is yes. We have made sure, in the school’s policy, that we’re working very hard to ensure that those who have extra needs, for instance, people with autism and cystic fibrosis, get that extra support. It is, of course, very, very hard though when that clashes with the medical needs which have to come first. And for those who are in the shielded category, I’m afraid that the safest thing for them to do is to be shielded, which is not just to stay at home, but really be protected from all contact because of the consequences should they get the disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (20:08);Yes. I think I agree. That’s right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (20:11);Thank you very much and thank you for your question. And of course, you mentioned a vaccine and we’re all working incredibly hard to try to get a vaccine as soon as possible. But again, the science behind that is uncertain and so the timings are uncertain. And thank you very much for those two questions from the public. I think that this is working well, having questions from members of the public. I’m very grateful to all those who have submitted and it’s something that we’re going to keep on doing. So thanks very much. And now we’ll turn to Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (20:46);Thank you very much. I wanted to raise the subject of PPE. I know it’s been discussed several times at this occasion before, but it’s still a talking point after Panorama and also a survey of doctors suggesting some are of concern still. What assurances can you give front line staff that there will be adequate supplies of PPE in the days and weeks ahead?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (21:08);Well, thank you, Hugh. The issue of PPE is incredibly important and making sure that there are the supplies of PPE so that everybody on the front line has the PPE and the protective equipment that they need. As you know, we’ve been moving heaven and earth to get the amount of PPE that we need to the frontline, both buying it from abroad and also then distributing it. That system is getting stronger all of the time, but it is a mammoth effort to do it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (21:44);I saw two of the things that you referred to, I’m not sure that they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation, but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the front line and we we take full responsibility to getting it to every single person who needs it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (22:08);Can I ask a quick follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (22:08);Yes, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (22:10);Can you assure staff that stocks are not running low at the moment?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (22:16);Well, I can assure staff that the PPE that we need according to the agreed guidelines, that is available. We’re constantly needing to buy more from abroad and to make more at home to make sure we’re constantly replenishing that. And that’s a huge effort. Globally, there’s a shortage of PPE because the demand for PPE, understandably, in so many countries has shot up. And therefore, we’re out buying it around the rest of the world. And I’m really glad that a whole host of factories here in the UK are turning over their production towards PPE. It’s incredibly important. It’s a huge amount of effort. And we’re working on it as hard as we possibly can. Thanks, Hugh. Paul Brand from ITV. We’ve lost your audio, Paul."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (23:18);Hopefully you can hear me now, Secretary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (23:19);Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (23:20);Excellent. Given today’s statistics, Health Secretary, do you now recognize that while you’ve prevented the NHS from becoming overwhelmed, there is now a crisis in the care sector? And given that the number of deaths continues to go up in care homes each day, will it now be your main priority?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (23:38);Well, of course care homes have been a top priority right from the start. We put out our first guidance to care homes in February and we’ve been working with them throughout. Now, by their nature, care homes look after and support some of the most vulnerable people anyway. And they support some of the people who are most vulnerable to this disease as well because of the nature of the disease and how it impacts on, especially on older people much more than the rest of the population. So it’s been a focus from the start. We’ve strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and improved infection control. And also making testing available throughout the care sector I think is incredibly important as we’ve ramped up the availability of testing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (24:36);We keep a close eye on it and I’m very glad that we’re now able to publish these daily data, which will keep the focus on what’s happening in care homes. I asked for that to start and I think we talked about it a week or so ago and now we’ve got those data being collected so that we can focus on it day in, day out. And my principle in this is to be as transparent as possible because then you find problems as quickly as possible. And we-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (25:07);You say that you’ll keep an eye on it, but carers are frustrated. And I understand this is a complex sector. There’s lots of private providers here. It’s not like the NHS. And that’s a fair point that you have often made. But given that the number of deaths in care homes continues to go up every day, surely this has to be your first priority now. This looks as though this is where the virus continues to spread."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (25:29);The spread of the virus through care homes is absolutely a top priority, yes. And on the testing, I think John Newton wanted to add something."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (25:36);Well, yes. I mean, it is absolutely right that care homes are a focus. And in fact, we’ve done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. And what that showed was that the presence of symptoms was not a very good marker in the care home setting, both amongst residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. So there were significant numbers of residents who were asymptomatic who had the virus. And so we’ve massively increased the amount of testing available. So we’ve now tested 25,000."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (26:03);The amount of testing available. So we’ve now tested 25,000 residents in care homes and we’re rolling out testing now to symptomatic and asymptomatic residents as well as providing testing through the drive incentives and through the other means that Secretary of State’s mentioned for staff. And we think that will really make a difference combined with intensive infection control methods informed by much more widely available testing. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (26:26);Thanks, John. Nick Martin from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (26:31);Very good afternoon. A question for all of you, but the health secretary first. I just want to clarify something you said in your introduction, Secretary of State. You said the proportion of corona deaths in care homes is around the sixth of the total. In week 16, which I think is ending April the 17th, care home deaths were actually 23% of the official COVID deaths. And of total deaths, not just COVID, closer to a third. Are you saying that the number of people who’ve died in care homes during this crisis is around in line with the number of deaths you would normally see in any other year?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (27:06);No, I’m absolutely not saying that latter point. What I was saying very clearly is that, in the statistics that have been published so far, the number of deaths from coronavirus in care homes is around a sixth in total. But of course the breakdown of the statistics, exactly as you say, shows that that proportion is changing and we’ve got to… So, I was putting it in the broad context, but also saying that it is an absolute focus of ours because it’s an area which you’ve highlighted many times in the past under an area where we’ve got a huge amount of focus. Thanks. Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (27:59);Could I just have a followup please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:00);Yes, of course. Of course, Nick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (28:02);I’m so sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:03);No problem."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (28:04);A lot of people have died in care homes. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. And you knew and your department knew that this was a high risk area. You have a huge guidance to care homes repeatedly over the last few months, and yet PP was inadequate, tests for the most part were few and far between, but yet the deaths in care homes seem to take you and your department by surprise. And this isn’t meant to be a clever, catch you out question at all, but I wonder if you will take this opportunity to apologize to those families of loved ones who died in care homes because the government didn’t properly protect them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:45);The thing is, Nick, I think that’s unreasonable as a question, actually. And I know you care an awful lot about this, but, from the start, we know, we knew that there was a very significant challenge with care homes, not least because of the frailty of the residents and the enormous work that’s gone on within government, Public Health England, and local authorities, and the CQC to monitor this from the start. It has been more difficult to get data flowing, and I’m very glad we’re able to do that now on a daily basis instead of a weekly basis as before, and making sure that care homes have the support they need has been absolutely at front of mind right from the start."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (29:36);In fact, I can remember in one of the very early discussions about coronavirus in January, having a discussion about, because one of the first things we knew about this virus was that it had a very strong age profile, as in it was much more dangerous for older people. That immediately drew our attention to the fact that there was a big challenge in care homes, especially because people are more frail, and therefore they are more at risk. It’s something that we focused on right from the start and something that’s been a huge challenge throughout, and we’re constantly learning from what happens and trying to improve the way that we support people across the care sector."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (30:23);Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (30:25);Secretary of State, why didn’t you bring in tests earlier? It just seems odd that it took a while for tests to come through. If you knew the risks and, as you just clearly said, why did it take you so long to give the sector what it was crying out for, and that was tests?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (30:41);Well, we have been testing in care homes right from the start and throughout the crisis. So that’s one of the things in your question that I dispute, and I know the passion that you have for this subject. But it is really important to base, for us to explain what’s been going on and we’ve been testing right from the start. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:02);It’s important to understand that, from the word go, Public Health England has been investigating any outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes. And the approach there would be to test a limited number, when test capacity was limited, we’re talking about beginning of April, test capacity was limited to test a number of index cases to clarify that it was an outbreak of coronavirus. Then the whole care home would be treated as if the symptomatic cases were all coronavirus and various measures were put in place, and no doubt many lives saved as a result."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:33);Obviously, now we have more testing and we have more knowledge about the way the virus spreads in care homes. We’re able to adapt that and we’ll be even more effective. But it would be wrong to say that testing was not available and not used. And it would also be wrong to say that nothing was done about these outbreaks. A great deal was done, but we’re confident we can be more effective now than in the past."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:52);The issue of care homes is an international one. Every country in Europe has had a significant problem with a large proportion of the deaths from coronavirus occurring in the care home sector. We are no different in that respect. And the care home sector is a highly distributed system. It’s intrinsically difficult to deliver services to that sector. But nevertheless, a huge effort has been made in collaboration with organizations like the Care Quality Commission and also local government. So a lot has been done. We all want to do more and we are, certainly with testing, we’re going to be able to do a lot more with this additional capacity that Secretary of State described. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (32:29);Thanks, Nick. Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Ben Kentish: (32:33);Thank you. Good afternoon to you all. Secretary of State, I know you’ve said you’re following the science on this, but it’s been almost a week since your scientific advisors made a new recommendation in relation to the use of face masks, Scotland today becoming the latest country to recommend they are used in public places. Are you able to tell us about the deliberations you’re making on that, what the delay is, and when we’re likely to hear some sorts of ruling, some sorts of advice on that? And if I could also ask very quickly to Professor McLean another practical question. Experts in some countries have given very clear advice about stopping the spread of this disease from surfaces. I know you’ve recommended washing hands. But other countries, for example, are saying people should be disinfecting their washing, takeaway boxes, anything really coming into their house. Are you recommending British people do those sorts of things too? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (33:24);They’re all questions to Professor McLean. What I’d say is that, on face masks, we are guided by the science, and the government position hasn’t changed. Professor McLean will explain the science. The UK Government position hasn’t changed, not least because this most important thing people can do is the social distancing as opposed to the weak science on face masks. There is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it. So that is our absolute priority in terms of the message to the public, that the social distancing, staying at home is the thing that is helping to save lives by flattening the curve. That is the number one thing. Professor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Professor McLean: (34:12);The recommendation from SAGE is completely clear, which is that there is weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent a source of infection of going from somebody who is infected to the people around them. Now of course under our current circumstances, anybody who has symptoms really must stay at home. And that’s the thing that people have done so brilliantly. But we are also concerned that some people are infected who don’t have symptoms or maybe don’t have symptoms yet, and that is the reason that SAGE has put so much effort into looking at this question. But the answer is clear that the evidence is weak and the effect is small. And we’ve passed that on to our colleagues in government with which to make a decision. Turning onto your question about hand washing and keeping surfaces clean, we have always absolutely been really majored on hand washing because that’s the way you keep the inside of your house and your family safe when you come in from outdoors. We would also recommend always keeping the surfaces in your house clean. That would seem like common sense to me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (35:27);Thanks very much. Thanks, Ben. The next question is from Dominic [Yaton 00:35:32] at the metro. Dominic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Dominic: (35:35);Hello, Secretary of State. You said that you knew from the start that there was a very significant challenge with care homes. So why were care homes not told to ban visitors until March the 16th? And why were figures on deaths outside hospitals not published until March 31st?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (35:57);The collection of the information from the care home sector has been more difficult than from the NHS by the distributed nature of the care system. There’s 15,000 care homes, and they’re part of 10,000 different organizations. And so, I’m glad we managed to get the data collection. On the point about visitors, that was based on clinical advice. And I’ll explain the reason that our clinical advisors gave us, which is that before there was a widespread incidence of coronavirus across the community as a whole, the critical thing is that, in a care home, having visitors also has a positive impact both against the loneliness of the residents but also on their longevity and their mental health. So these are difficult judgments and there are no easy recommendations to make. And so, absolutely, we are guided by that clinical advice."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (37:12);When it was necessary to make that change, which is quite a firm change, then we did so. So, I understand. Of course I understand the focus now on care homes and the questions from the media, but it’s something we’ve been working on incredibly hard right from the start. And really, one of the things that has happened in this crisis is that social care alongside the NHS have both been seen as these two absolutely vital parts of our society. And I think that that’s a good thing that we recognize and value them in that way. James Kayvan at the Daily Star."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","James Kayvan: (37:58);Hi. I just wanted to ask, first of all, there’s increasing frustration over what people see as mixed messaging from the government around the social distancing measures. On the one hand we’ve seen long queues at DIY stores, while on the other police are moving people on for sitting alone outside and sunbathing in parks. As increasing numbers of people return to work and roads get busier, can you give greater clarity what you can and can’t do outside the house?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","James Kayvan: (38:20);And second, if I can just ask, there’ve been reports that ventilator productions is now being scaled back just weeks after you called on British industry to build thousands for the NHS. Will we be in a situation soon where we have a huge supply of these machines [inaudible 00:38:33] demand? And I just wondered what’s going to happen with that supply and will the production of new ventilators continue to be scaled back or do you still want more for the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (38:42);Thanks very much, indeed. Look, on the clarity, I can absolutely give you that clarity, James, which is that people should follow the social distancing rules and they should stay at home if at all possible because that protects the NHS. And so far the protection of the NHS is working. And this brings me to the second point, which is that…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (39:03);This brings me to the second point which is that it is good news that there are spare ventilated beds available in the NHS. There has been no point when somebody’s needed a ventilator and a ventilator has not been available, a ventilated bed, because it’s more than just the ventilator machine, of course you need the people as well to use them. That has been one of the things in this crisis that people said right at the start, that preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed will be extremely difficult. Some people told me to my face it would be impossible, but that so far has worked, and now with the number of people in the NHS in hospital with coronavirus falling, we can see that we’ve managed to keep the NHS able to treat everybody who needs it. That brings to the question of ventilators. We are still, yes, producing those ventilators."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (39:54);There are countries across the world who are now needing them because their curve is in a different position, and so we’re still working with those companies who I pay tribute to who’ve absolutely pulled the stops out and made sure that we have the ventilator capacity that we needed when the number of people on ventilators was at its peak, which I think was about three weeks ago, [inaudible 00:01:20]? About that. So I pay tribute to the ventilator challenge and everybody who participated in it, they’ve done an amazing job, and they have, and so far it’s been successful in ensuring we’ve always got those ventilators that people need. Chris Lloyd from the Northern Echo."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Chris Lloyd: (40:41);Afternoon. Thanks for having me. What is the time lag of the pandemics progress? As the country went into lockdown at the same time, is it possible that the regions, like here in the northeast, were locked down comparatively early and so might not be hit as hard as was once feared? Although I note in your earlier slide there was a slight uptake in all regions outside of London of the number of people in hospital. And will that have any impact on a second wave in the regions? And how will the time lag inform policy on lifting the lockdown? Do you imagine that some areas might ease before others or will we all be in or out of lockdown together, and then, hopefully I’m not outstaying my welcome here. Looking further ahead, northern manufacturing towns bore the brunt of previous economic downturns, so how will the government ensure its measures to help the country recover are regionally applicable in terms of manufacturing, infrastructure, even moving government jobs out of London?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (41:37);Well Chris, you’re very welcome here at the press conference. I’m going to ask Angela to answer the substance of the first part of your question, but the first thing I’d say is I want to pay tribute to the people of the northeast for staying at home and helping to ensure that the number of cases in the northeast has relatively low. And knowing Newcastle well as I do, I know that the people of the Northeast are very gregarious and have done their duty by staying at home, which is what is needed in these circumstances. On the economic question that you rightly raise, absolutely it is a top priority to make sure that we level up this country and that agenda will be, I think even more important once we’re through coronavirus and recovering from it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (42:37);Northeast councils have been allocated more than 600 million pounds as part of the business support package, and we’ve identified more than 50,000 business properties which may be able to receive a grant in the Northeast. So we are putting the economic support in place during the crisis, but I’m absolutely sure that after the crisis, the top priority of the government will be to level up and make sure that all parts of this country can recover together because that is going to be a huge task. If I can ask Professor McLean to answer on the shape of the curve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (43:20);Your observation is absolutely right, that London was always high above the other regions of England and evolved administrations, and interestingly there is a signal in there that London turned over perhaps a little bit earlier than other regions, and various of our scientists around the country are combing through that data and other places where we might be able to see that signal to see if they can find anything to explain why that should be so. If there is an effect, it’s quite small actually. It’s not a huge, great big difference between the regions. You are right that yesterday’s numbers were a little bit higher in most regions and the day before, but it’s a tiny effect. It’s well within the noise that we see in these data sets. I watched these data incredibly carefully and whilst I would much rather they went down absolutely regularly every day, an increase like that is not something that worries me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (44:22);The question of whether or not we should have regional policies, I think it’s a really interesting one. It’s the kind of thing that you can imagine epidemiologists all over the world, not just in this country, are puzzling over. I think there’s always a trade off, isn’t there, between making sure you do things that are incredibly beautifully tailored to each part of your population. And on the other hand, keeping things simple and actually also carrying on all being in this together. So I don’t have an answer for you for that at the moment, but I can reassure you that all the time, one of the things we do is we look at the data altogether and we disaggregate it and look at it in regions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (45:05);Thanks very much Chris. Have you got a follow up question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Chris Lloyd: (45:07);Yeah. I mean, I did ask about the time lag as well and whether different parts of the country might be ease from the lockdown at different times because of the time lag, or will we all be under the lockdown at the same time together?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (45:19);So that is a question that we’re looking at. There was a big benefit, I think, as we brought in the lockdown measures of the whole country moving together. We did think about moving with London and the Midlands first because they were more advanced in terms of the number of cases, but we decided that we are really in this together and the shape of the curve, if not the height of the curve, has been very similar across the whole country. It went up more in London, but it’s also come down more. But the broad shape has been similar, which is what you’d expect given that we’ve all been living through the same lockdown measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (46:02);The other thing to say is that it isn’t just about the level, it’s also about the slope of the curve, and if the R goes above one anywhere, then that would eventually lead to an exponential rise and a second peak and an overwhelming of the NHS in that area unless it’s addressed. So although the level of the number of cases is different in different parts, the slope of the curve has actually been remarkably similar across the country. So that argues for doing things as a whole country together. I hope that makes sense. Thanks very much for coming Chris. Appreciate it. Finally, Adam Vaughn from The New Scientist."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Adam Vaughn: (46:48);Hi, you said you were recruiting 18,000 contact tracers. I wanted to ask, how many do you have today, what date will you hit 18,000 and how important are those tracers as a strategy for controlling the virus after the lockdown? And secondly, we heard today that the NHS contact tracing out where will be ready within three weeks. What’s your goal for the number of people you want to download it and how will you incentivize them to do so?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (47:16);I knew we’d get some tough questions from The New Scientist. The answer to your questions are as soon as possible and as many as possible. But I know that’s not exactly a numerical answer. We’re recruiting the contact tracers. I’m sorry I don’t have the information to hand as to exactly how many we’ve recruited, but that is underway. We hope to have the contact tracers who will help when we find a positive test to work out who they’ve been in contact with and make sure they do the appropriate thing. We hope to have the contact tracers in place before or at the same as the app goes live and you’re right on the app."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (47:59);We’re expecting that to be ready by the middle of May and both of these things together, because they work together along with the testing and they’ll help us to keep the level of new cases down once we’ve used social distancing measures to get those new cases down. That’s the best thing for health and it’s the best thing for the economy. It’s a work in progress. I appreciate that, other than saying the middle of May, I haven’t given you numerical details. I don’t have the data to hand, but I’ll try to find that for you. And then on the how many people, the more people who download the app and keep their Bluetooth on, the more effective the app is going to be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (48:49);So there is no answer other than as many as possible because if everybody downloads it will just be more effective at spotting who people have been in contact with through contact tracing and helping alongside the human contact tracing for people to be able to keep the R down by catching those who they may have transmitted the disease to. It’s also of course tied with the rules around isolation because if you are … What really also matters is if you’ve been in substantial contact with somebody who’s tested positive, making sure we get the right rules around what that person is then required and asked to do is also a critical part of this, this infrastructure that we’re building."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Speaker 3: (49:43);Well, I’d just ask a follow up question. From what you’ve just said, you said that the human contact traces and the app will work in tandem, and you’re saying if the app is coming in three weeks, does that mean the target for the 18,000 is in three weeks?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (49:56);Before or at the same time as the app. Yeah. Okay. Good stuff. Thank you very much indeed. Great to have The New Scientist at the Downing Street briefing and I hope my answer was scientifically valid. Thank you very much for joining us and no doubt see you again soon."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (00:02);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, and also professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England. Let me just start by saying I think, on behalf of us all, a huge congratulations to the prime minister and to Carrie on the wonderful news of the birth of their baby boy. I have spoken to the PM and I can tell you that both mum and son are doing really well. Now, next, let me give an update on the latest data on coronavirus from our Cobra data file. And I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program, as of today, there have now been 818,539 tests for the virus across the U.K., including 52,429 tests that took place yesterday. 165,221 people have tested positive. And that’s an increase of 4,076 cases on yesterday’s number."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (01:06);Now, as the health sector announced yesterday, from today, we’re moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths so that that’s in all settings are included wherever the individual has tested positive for COVID-19, rather than just those in hospitals. And those figures show that, up to yesterday on the new measure, we have recorded an additional 3, 811 deaths in total. And I think it’s just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period from the 2nd of March to the 28th of April. So, they don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (01:47);Sadly, today’s figures show an additional 765 deaths compared to yesterday. I’ll let professor Doyle talk us through the data in detail in a little while. But I think we must never lose sight of the fact that behind every statistic there are many human lives that have been tragically lost before their time. We also pay tribute, of course, to those caring for the sick. And yesterday at 11 o’clock in the morning, the whole country observed a minute silence, a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of all of our frontline workers who have died whilst dedicated themselves to caring for and serving others."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (02:28);Now, on the 16th of April, I set out five principles that would guide our approach to the transition away from the current set of social distancing measures in place and into a second phase. We continue to see evidence in the data of a flattening of the peak of the virus. And that is only happening because we delivered on the two central pillars of our strategic approach to defeating coronavirus. The first one was that we reinforced our NHS capacity through the Nightingale Hospitals, the extra critical care capacity, more ventilator beds, and extra doctors and nurses on the front line. And the second is that we introduced the social distancing measures at the right time, guided by the scientific and medical evidence. And the public’s overwhelming support for those rules has helped save lives and protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (03:18);Now, we’re still coming through the peak. And this is, as I’ve said before, a delicate and dangerous moment in this crisis. So, I know that a lot of people have made a lot of sacrifices, which is why it’s so important that we don’t let up now and risk undoing all of that hard work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (03:38);So, as we look to the future, our five tests remain absolutely key. First, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, preventing it from being overwhelmed. Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths. Thirdly, we need to see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels across all the relevant areas and settings. And fourth, we must be confident the NHS will be able to cope with future demands. And that includes as a result of any changes to existing measures or new measures that we may need to take."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (04:17);Fifth, and I think this is probably the most critical of the five principles, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. A second spike will be harmful to public health. And it would result in many more deaths from COVID-19. That itself would lead to a second lockdown, inflicting further prolonged economic pain on the country. And, as the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said last week, that wouldn’t just be economically dangerous. It would inflict a serious blow to public confidence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (04:56);So, this issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it, it’s not a theoretical risk. And it’s not something that’s just confined to the United Kingdom. Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the last week, they’ve seen a rise in the transmission rate of Coronavirus. Chancellor Merkel has said publicly, and she’s made it clear that they might need a second lockdown in Germany if the infection rate continues to rise. So, this is a very real risk. And it’s vital we proceed carefully guided by the scientific advice so that our next step through this crisis is a sure footed one. We mustn’t gamble away the sacrifices and the progress that we’ve made. We must continue to follow the scientific evidence. And we must continue to take the right decisions at the right moment in time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (05:45);Now, we are working on all of the potential options for a second phase. There is light at the end of the tunnel, whether you’re an NHS worker on the frontline working tirelessly shift after shift, or a parent at home with young children. But we do need to be patient and we need to be careful as we come through what is a moment of maximum risk. So, we’ll wait for Sages next review of the data in early May. We’re ramping up the testing with capacity now at over 73,000 per day and 52,429 tests carried out per day. And eligibility for those tests is now being expanded again further to include anyone who needs to go to work and can’t work remotely and who has symptoms. It also includes anyone over 65 with symptoms and all care home residents, as well as care home staff. And, at the same time, as we ramp up the testing capacity, we’ll keep working on our tracking and tracing capability, which is going to be a key component in the next phase of this crisis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (06:52);We’ll continue to source ventilators and personal protective equipment both at home and abroad. Paul Dayton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production and supply. We continue to source PPE from abroad. We’re setting ourselves out as the international buyer of choice in the international marketplace. And I can tell you that, in the last ten days, we’ve secured over five million masks from China. We’ve had three flights with gowns from Turkey. Because we know that every single one of those items of PPE is needed by those working so hard on the front line, both in NHS and also in our care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (07:31);And our international effort isn’t confined to procurement. I can tell you we’ve also made enormous progress in returning British nationals who otherwise would have been at risk of being stranded abroad. And it’s worth just noting that, since the outbreak in Wu Han, we’ve helped an estimated 1.3 million British nationals return on commercial flights. And we’ve done that by working with the airlines and with those governments to make sure that the flights can run and that the airspace is left open. And we brought back over 200,000 British nationals from Spain, 50,000 from Australia, and over 11,000 from Pakistan, to name but just three countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (08:12);As well as those commercial flights, we’ve also chartered flights where commercial options were not possible. And we’ve now reached the stage where we’ve brought back over 20,000 British nationals on 21 flights. And that includes 9,000 British nationals who had been brought back from India, 2,000 from South Africa, and 1,200 from Peru."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (08:34);So, it’s also, just in terms of repatriations, worth bearing in mind that on the 17th of March when we changed our travel advice for those traveling on cruise ships, there were something like 19,000 British passengers on 60 cruise ships sailing around the world. And, as the border restrictions were put in place by country after country, we faced a daunting task in getting our people home. But we stuck at it. And six weeks later, we’ve now got all 19,000 British passengers back home, safe and sound."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (09:11);So, that was an enormous effort. And we recognize that the job isn’t yet done. We’ll continue with this unprecedented effort with further charter flights coming back from New Zealand, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, amongst others, over the next week or so. So, I must pay tribute, at this point, to all of the outstanding work our conciliar teams working night and day at the FCO in London, but also at our embassies and our high commissioners around the world have been putting in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (09:40);Finally, the Health Secretary announced last week that U.K. trials have started as we draw on the incredible scientific talent that we’ve got in this country to pursue a vaccine. And that effort too has an international dimension to it. So, today we announced that the U.K. will provide GAVI, which is the International Vaccine Alliance, with the equivalent of 330 million pounds each year over the next five years as we seek to come up with a vaccine, both to protect the British people, but also to help immunize millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people right around the world, combining the depth of our innovative knowhow with the big hearted determination that has characterized our national effort to defeat the Coronavirus. And having said that, I’m now going to ask Yvonne to talk us through the latest data slides. Yvonne, over to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (10:31);Thank you, Secretary of State. We have a selection of measures and slides here today to show. And the first one is just to remind us of the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. As the Secretary of State has said, this is about capacity, it’s about a fall in the daily deaths, it’s about reliable data, and also that we have good supplies of material for our NHS and care staff and that we’re confident that the adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (11:05);But moving to the actual slides, and the next slide, please, shows what is going on out in society at the moment. This is a transport slide which shows the use of various forms of transport. As we’ve seen up to now, very dramatic falls in most modes, but there has been an uptick in motor vehicles. And the message here really is that we are still passing through this peak. And this use of motor vehicles, it’s the highest working day use since the 23rd of March. And we really have to be vigilant that most people are making huge efforts to stay at home and save lives. And this is slightly worrying. So, please do stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives, and go out for the necessities. And the transport data will reflect that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (12:02);And the next slide, please, is about new cases in the NHS and in the country at the moment, in the UK. And we can see here the increasing amount of testing that’s going on through the orange bars. But basically, the cases have remained broadly stable over the last weeks. And that is good news. But I want to move on really to show you a little more about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (12:27);The next slide, please, does show this. So, now we have a slide about people in hospital. And this is broadly good news because the numbers in hospital have decreased from over 18,000 to over 15,000. That’s a 16% decrease. And it’s manifest in all regions. You can see how London had an early peak. But now, London is declining in its use of hospital facilities. But, of course, other regions may overtake that. So, we do have to be careful. As I say, we are passing through this peak. We’re not through this yet. And the next slide, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (13:03);… To speak. We’re not through this yet. And the next slide, thank you is about critical care bed use in the UK and this means all beds, both high dependency and intensive care wards use, and this is good news because we can see here that 40% of the beds are being used. That means there is critical care capacity, and that is a credit to the NHS for how it has got us through this crisis to this stage, and there is capacity and room for patients who need it. The next slide please is about the cumulative daily COVID deaths. Now this is an interesting slide where we’ll begin to get into a little bit more into what is going on with deaths. So the deaths in hospital is the blue line, and that is what has been measured very reliably up to now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (13:52);But now public health England, with support from the NHS, has been in a position to congregate deaths in all settings based on confirmed tests that we see coming through our labs. So what we can see here is first of all that the deaths on the orange line are confirmed deaths from coronavirus, that tells us what exactly is going on in all settings. And when I say all settings, I mean hospitals, health protection team, the local outbreak teams in the community broadly and in care homes. So now we see that there is a divergence. It’s not a huge, it’s about a 20% divergence, but it’s good news in the main in terms of what it is showing because what it’s showing is we are getting a comprehensive picture and this is most important for control. So could I move on to the next slide please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (14:46);Which is about the daily deaths, which is excluding deaths outside of hospital. So these are hospital deaths, which is what we were looking at in the previous slide in the blue side. It shows this declining trend of deaths in hospitals, which the trend started to increase at the end of March and we can see it declining. But to restress, we’re still coming through the peak because of course this doesn’t represent all deaths, but it is good news about deaths in hospital and that is also a credit to the good treatment in hospital. The next slide looks at COVID deaths in all settings and you can see there it’s a cumulative line there, the orange line. And it’s good to do it that way because otherwise you get swings and ups and downs when weekends occur and people are not sure what has happened with deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (15:42);But with the line you can see the trend and the trend is quite flat actually. And it may begin to decline, but we’re not convinced of that yet. But it’s good to show that. And the reason it starts at the 30th of March is because this is about all settings. That was the time when we were able to start measuring that from then on. And so this is a seven day rolling average and it clearly … And it’s very important, we know what’s happening daily. Now on to global. So global death comparisons are two slides here. The first one is actually just crude numbers. And you can see here a portion that looks like the United States has a very high number of deaths and other countries perhaps are aligning with each other. But the point on this slide, the slide says a number of things."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (16:33);First of all, and these measures may not be comprehensive measures of death … And we’re very keen to do here and are doing now comprehensively. So for instance in Spain, we’re not absolutely clear whether the deaths in Spain include all care home deaths. And this is understandable because it’s very complex and difficult to get these measures, particularly on a daily basis, which is why the news today about being able to do this on a daily basis is very good news. Although of course the news about numbers of deaths is not good news and, again, stresses how dangerous this virus is, how sad it is for those individuals, and how we have to be ever vigilant about how we look after each other and how we adhere to the requests to stay at home, protect the NHS, and particularly to save lives. Now the last slide is also interesting because this now shows the cumulative death number per million population, and this shows a very different pattern where we can see two measures for the UK, the hospital deaths and the comprehensive deaths. They’re not hugely different on this scale, but you can see where we are now tracking much more along our European neighbors and also, and we’ve seen Italy and Spain there and France, but the US of course has dropped because we’re now measuring rates per a million. Other countries have increased. The important thing here is that it is … Our measures are comprehensive, they’re daily and they’re taken in all care settings. So I thought you would wish to see the two contrasts. Thank you [inaudible 00:18:22]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (18:22);Thank you very much indeed. I think we’ll now turn to questions from the media and I think first up we’ve got Hugh Pin from the BBC. Hugh, you there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Hugh Pin: (18:34);Foreign secretary, question about testing. What support will you give care homes in administering and organizing tests and helping them keep residents and staff safe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (18:49);Well, I’m happy to let either Yvonne or Jonathan come in, but just to be clear, we’ve expanded the eligibility. Eligibility now includes anyone in a care home where they’re resident or staff and we have obviously had a distribution issue. There’s no sugarcoating the challenge we’ve had with that, we’ve helped deliver them through the local resilience forum. We are getting the clipper service up and running and the military have also done an exceptional job. So whether it’s the supply, and which we’re ramping up in the way I described and the health secretary has explained, or the delivery, are we doing everything that we possibly can? Yvonne, I don’t know whether you or Jonathan want to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (19:33);Well and thanks. Yes indeed Hugh. So there are a number of ways that testing is and will continue to happen at scale in care homes since this epidemic in care homes, which still continues and there has been a huge local effort both through local government, our directors of public health, our health protection teams, but increasingly with support from national endeavors to get the tests to the home to make sure staff get the testing they need. This will continue for some considerable time until we are convinced that we have got under this epidemic in the care homes, which is of course utmost concern."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (20:11);Anything else you’d like to ask on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Hugh Pin: (20:14);Couldn’t testing really have started sooner than that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (20:18);Well, Hugh, testing has always occurred during outbreaks and that has never been given up at a local level. Our health protection team supported by others, the NHS locally, have been into and going into care homes throughout the country. But the scale and the speed of this epidemic is really in the last couple of weeks, and there is a huge national and local endeavor to both not just test, which is very important, but to also understand the measures that would make a difference in care homes. And to look at that in a very rapid way looking at the evidence so that we can put in place measures that protect people. People are absolutely passionate about getting this right, but it is the most complex sector to get to 16,000 homes, a lot of places to go under … Critical to use local intelligence as to where the risks are highest."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (21:11);Also Hugh it’s just worth saying that of course you’d have to have an enormous testing capacity to deliver what I think you’re suggesting we could have or should have. One of the big challenges we’ve had is asymptomatic people coming to and in and out of care homes, whether it’s other care home workers who work in more than one place and it just staff coming in or indeed members of a family and there’s an onset, it’s obviously a very decentralized system, but the social distancing and the control over transmission in and out of care homes, it’s probably the single biggest factor and obviously we’re doing everything we can to give the guidance and give the support to care homes to achieve that. Dan Hughet, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Hughet: (21:55);Thank you secretary of state. And we’ve discovered that hospices are being denied access to government managed supplies of PPE, of personal protective equipment. Unlike hospitals and care homes, they are not being included in the main NHS supply chain managed by the government through supply chain coordination limited. Instead, hospice are still relying on donations of PPE and they’re having to buy their own largely on the open market at hugely inflated prices. It means the hospices have told us that they could run out of PPE within a matter of days. Why is it the hospices are being treated differently to hospitals and care homes when it comes to accessing PPA?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (22:32);Well, again, I’ll defer to Jonathan and Yvonne, but basically, and I don’t know of course the hospices that you’ve talked to, but we’ve been guided throughout by the NHS about, A, where the shortfalls have been and, B, what’s the priority? And we’ve always said that the priority is being on the frontline and the NHS and care homes. But obviously we want to make sure we’ve got enough PPE. That’s why we’re doing all of these flights from abroad, that’s why Paul Dayton’s ramping up the domestic capacity to get to anyone that may need it. And obviously hospice is a very important area as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (23:09);Yeah, secretary of state. It’s very important we ascertain where these problems are and that’s why local intelligence is very important. The guidance covers all places where people are at risk. So that’s very important to say. There is no differentiation here in where people are at risk and what they might need. What may often be lacking is the knowledge of where there are pockets of problems, and we’ve had this throughout. So it is welcome to know this and there are ways in which hospices can actually make known what they need through helplines. But if that isn’t happening then it’s very important that we do hear this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (23:45);Thank you. Do you want to supplement anything you want to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Hughet: (23:49);Yeah. Thank you so secretary of state. On that, Hospice UK, the main charity, I understand they’ve been coordinating and speaking to the relevant bodies within government to explain and have provided evidence that shows they need this PPE. So you’re absolutely right to say must go where it needs to, but they have made a very strong case to say they need it. They’re treating three times as many terminally ill patients now than they were this time last year. They’re treating people with coronavirus, so they definitely do need this PPE. I think the assurance they want is when they’ll be included in the NHS supply chain because they say they are caring for very second vulnerable people as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (24:26);Oh absolutely. And my heart goes out to all of those working in hospices, those that have been cared for and their family and we’ll do everything we can in the way Yvonne described to make sure that we get PPPE to them as soon as we physically can. Beth Rippe from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Beth Rippe: (24:44);Thank you. First, secretary of state, on Sunday you said you were, and I quote you, reasonably confident that deaths in care homes are coming down at about the same rate more broadly as captured by the NHS figures. What does this new data tell you? Are we actually approaching a peak in care homes, if not overall? And Professor Van Tom, extra deaths today show the situation even worse than we knew. But it’s true too that these numbers could be underreported still in part because of low testing levels. Should we be braced for a farther upward revision of these figures in the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (25:25);So Beth, look. In the way that Yvonne described the importance of getting these measures refined is that we’ve got a clearer picture and of course what we’d like is a perfect picture and we’re constantly looking to see whether we can modify and glean a more granular picture. The reality is, and I think when Sage gave its evidence on its review of the social distancing measures around the 16th of April, I think it was the press conference, so it was shortly before then. They were very clear that the R level was coming down. It was below one in the community, but there were challenges in hospital settings. We’re getting to grips with that, but also in-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (26:03);There were challenges in hospital settings. We’re getting to grips with that, but also in care homes. So we’ve known about this challenge, and we’re doing everything we can to meet it. PPE is one of the aspects of it, testing is another, but probably the single biggest thing, and this is tough in a decentralized, localized set of care homes, is making sure that we control the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that may risk transmitting the virus. So alongside all of those other practical measures, disseminating that guidance, refining that guidance, supporting those care homes as best we can is the surest way that we will really get a grip and then drive down those infection levels in the care home scenario. Yvonne, is there anything you’d like to add, or Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (26:47);I might just add, but Jonathan can supplement this. So Beth, the question is opposite to what CQC also measures. So CQC will also put out deaths in care homes, and they will not always be confirmed by testing. So in due course, those deaths sadly may occur on death certificates. So we may expect more than we’re seeing at the moment. Yes. Sorry, Jonathan, that was just my [crosstalk 00:27:18]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (27:17);And it’s worth just bearing in mind, as Yvonne said earlier in relation to the slides, what we’re trying to do is get the most granular picture. I think when it comes to the international comparisons, certainly not all of the countries are recording even to the level that we’ve got to now, which is why some of those international comparisons, but we’re just committed to maximum transparency. One because people should know the full picture and secondly, when you know more about the data, you’ve got a better chance of gripping it in the way that we’re absolutely committed to doing. Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:45);Yes. So thank you, Beth. I’ll answer your question in a slightly different way and say that clearly we have moved to a system of recording deaths that is better and more granular because it covers more than just the hospital setting, but in epidemiology terms, eventually we will be able to compute a different estimate of deaths called excess deaths and that is really accepting that across the year deaths go up in the winter and down in the summer in a broadly oscillating wave and one can work out what the average is over multiple years and then work out what in this particular coronavirus pandemic our departure has been from that in terms of total number of deaths. And that will give us an excess death figure and that will be highly comparable when other excess death figures come out across the world, including many parts of Europe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:46);In fact, there’s a standardized methodology that the Europeans use for calculating excess mortality. So to your point, will there be more? I think I’d kind of turn that question slightly or turn the answer and say in time we’ll have a much better answer when we start to look at excess mortality as a total, which will take into account both deaths related to COVID-19 and deaths that may have occurred, not due to COVID-19 at all, but as a consequence of the crisis. And some of those will take time to come through and I’m afraid that is a phenomenon that we will face right across the world with this awful crisis that we’re in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (29:34);Beth, do you want to pick up on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Beth: (29:36);Yeah, just quickly. Just to follow up, it’s been really encouraging that although the death toll has been horrific, but it has been falling in hospitals. Now you have the care home data, is it falling in hospitals, but that death tally going up still in care homes?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (29:52);I’m not sure we have the data, but I’ll-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (29:54);I don’t think we can say that quite yet, Beth. I wouldn’t make any predictions about what will happen in care homes, but we should know that soon because the hospital curve has declined. Bearing in mind that still the majority of deaths do occur in hospital, including those who are resident in care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (30:17);Beth, thanks very much. Andy Bell from Channel 5."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (30:21);Thanks very much. You have your five tests that you say have to be met before we can move on in terms of lockdown. Right now, how many of those tests do you think you’re passing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (30:35);Well, as I said, when I set them out, we will need the advice from SAGE, which was going to be three weeks after, I think the 16th of April, so it will come early May. So we don’t know yet. There is some positive signs in the data, but as Yvonne has said and as we’ve been at pains to say we’re at a delicate and dangerous moment in this challenge. We’re coming through the peak, but we’re not there yet, which is why keeping on focusing on the social distancing measures, which has been one of the great successes of the approach taken because of the support of the British people is so important. So people sitting at home watching this have saved lives by following that guidance. And until we’re out of the woods, if I can put it like that, they need to keep doing that. And we won’t know that we’ve reached that point until SAGE give us that review of the evidence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (31:24);I can I come back in on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (31:24);Sure, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (31:26);But the government has said several times that the NHS is not being overwhelmed, is not being overtopped. Are you saying you’re not even satisfied at this stage that you can say you’ve passed test number one?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (31:37);Well, then it just quite clearly hasn’t been overwhelmed. That’s been the second key critical bit of the strategy which we delivered successfully. It’s a great credit to those in the front line, but we have also got the ventilator beds, the critical care capacity up, the military have done a great job in supporting the new Nightingale hospitals. So we’re confident at this stage, but of course if you look at the five tests, Andy, and I know you’re taking this very seriously, we’ve also said that we need to make sure that we can see to the future that that will still be the case, and also with any changes we might make and what that would do, not just to the coronavirus infection rate as we’ve seen in Germany, but also to the non-COVID cases. We need to be confident the NHS will be able to cope. So you’re right, absolutely to point to the five tests, and I’ve just got to say at this moment in time, we’re waiting for SAGE’s evidence on all five aspects, which we’re expecting in early May."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (32:35);Can I bring in Jason Groves from the Daily Mail?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (32:40);Thanks. Foreign Secretary, you may have seen overnight the new mail force charity has brought in a million pounds with the PPE from China. You know how difficult that is. You’ve got your own challenges with PPE. I wondered how helpful that sort of private sector initiative is and to Professor Van-Tam, we’ve heard a little bit about this idea that the virus perhaps fades more slowly outdoors than it does indoors. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about that and what the implications of that might be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (33:13);Well, Jason, fantastic mail force campaign, a hundred thousand miles, 50,000 overalls, all going to those frontline workers in the NHS in care homes. I’ve just got to pay tribute, the Daily Mail has really contributed to that national effort that we were talking about and it all counts. So a huge thanks, I think from the government side."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:37);Jonathan. Okay, so thank you for the question about how the virus spreads and to what extent it spreads and if I can just replay the question back to you to be sure I heard it right. You were asking about the difference between indoors and outdoors?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (33:54);Yeah, that’s right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:56);Thank you. Okay, so we have learned a great deal over the years from studying influenza and patterns of transmission of influenza, and I accept that the coronavirus is a new virus, it is not entirely the same as influenza and we are getting more and more data on transmission of COVID-19 as the days and weeks roll by. But nevertheless there is a definite truism across all of the science literature that ventilation is the most critical part of reducing transmission from respiratory viruses. And if you think about being outdoors, first of all, by and large distancing between human beings is greater anyway, but if you just stand still for a moment and experience just normal breezes and air currents around you, you absolutely get a sense that any kind of plumes of anything are going to be very rapidly dispersed. And from that perspective it is absolutely categorically clear that outdoor spaces with higher degrees of ventilation are less problematic environments for transmission than indoor spaces."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:17);And of course you only have to go as far as thinking about flu and summer, winter and the way we live our lives. In the winter, we live indoors, in conditions of relatively low ventilation with the windows closed. In the summer, we go outdoors, we leave the doors and the windows open when we’re at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (35:38);Jason, do you want to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (35:39);Yeah. Well, thanks for your comments and I was going to come back on that latter point. People are obviously thinking about what’s going to happen in this next phase. Given that difference, might it mean that there is some hope for things like garden centers, outdoor events, like park runs, going to the beach, maybe even beer gardens before people sort of give up hope?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:04);Thank you for the question and I completely get it and understand why you’re asking the question. SAGE absolutely is keeping all of that evidence under very considerably detailed review and that evidence has been formulated into guidance that we are putting forwards to ministers on a periodic basis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:28);Now in terms of any of the settings that you mentioned, I just want to take us through the journey a little and say that these are complex and at various different points they might involve the congregation of individuals and one has to be very painstaking and very careful about thinking through some of these before we make the wrong move to relax measures. And so from that perspective, I think all of your comments are valid, but I think we have to be extremely surefooted and extremely painstaking about this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:12);This virus will absolutely come back. You’ve seen Secretary of State refer to the resurgence in Germany and the difficult considerations that are going on there. This is with us for quite some time, potentially for as long as until we get a vaccine. So from that perspective we have to be really careful and really surefooted, and I’m just not going to suggest for a moment that any of this should be rushed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (37:40);Thanks, Jason. Dan Bloom from the Daily Mirror."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Bloom: (37:43);Hello. I’d like to ask if we had been able to access better testing and screening earlier than we did for care home residents. So for example, were testing those discharged from hospital before mid-April and some of the other things the government has introduced, might some of the deaths that have been published today been avoided?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (38:03);I think there’s always learning in a unprecedented unique crisis like this that we’ll want to feed back in to make sure that we can refine and fine tune the measures we’re taking. You’ll know, Dan, we take the actions and the steps that we take on the best scientific evidence we’ve got at the time. I think in relation to care homes, and as I mentioned before, the key thing above all is to manage the transmission, of the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that might carry the virus. And that of course includes family members and friends, it includes people that are working in more than one care home setting, it includes NHS staff. So on top of testing and BP and all the things I understand you want to raise, I think that’s probably the single most important aspect. Do you want to come back on anything else there, Dan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Bloom: (38:53);I’d quite like to ask the medical experts, what they think of the same question because they may have an opinion on it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (39:00);Of course. Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (39:02);Yeah. Thank you, Dan-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (39:02);Of course. Yvonne?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (39:02);Yeah. Thank you Dan. So it’s a very good question and it’s also a learning one, but I put it this way, where there have been outbreaks in care homes, there has always been intervention throughout this. That would be no different to normal practice. What we have learned a lot about is how the virus is behaving in different populations. And one of the various other things that we have found is that the virus, when older people get this virus, it is affecting predominantly older people, particularly people over 75, and one of the reasons that the deaths are high there is that actually their demise quite quickly if they get the dose of this virus that perhaps a younger person might be able to put over their shoulder because of the way their immune system works. So that’s one feature. So it may not even be possible to have got to the test by the time the event happens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (39:54);Second, we’ve now learned from looking at the literature that we’ve asked and asked what is it that would make a difference to stop this epidemic in a home? And the movement of staff is an absolutely critical one and how the virus actually moves within a home. And that has really only begun to become evident since we’ve been able to look at new techniques like genomics. And that has given us a huge insight into the dynamics of what is happening within a home. And not every home will be the same in the way that people, residents and the staff interact, the use of bank staff. But there are some very interesting learning that we’ve come across quite recently. Now whether testing makes would have made a huge difference or not, it’s impossible to see at the moment. And that’s one thing we wanted learn but there has been testing but I think there are possibly more fundamental and structural issues about how care homes are run in an epidemic that we are now looking to implement."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (40:56);Thanks Dan. Matt Foster from Politics Home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Matt Foster: (41:00);Hi for secretary of state. Your colleagues have spoken about us all being in this together, but there are a sizable number of people in the UK who despite paying taxes are barred from claiming universal credit, housing benefit, or free school meals for their kids because the home office has deemed that they have no recourse to public funds. Some of those people are working in key frontline jobs right now in the NHS, social care, and its delivery drivers. Will the government consider at least temporarily causing an RPS status during the outbreak and if not, what reassurance can you give people that they’re not going to be shut out the same help we all may need to rely on during an economic crisis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (41:41);Look, I absolutely understand the point and obviously we feel for anyone who’s going through the challenges, whether professionally or in their home. I know the home secretary has been looking at this very carefully, she keeps these issues under constant review. I think she went before the home affairs committee today and said that we’ll always at new measures and what more can be done, particularly in relation, I think, to frontline workers from overseas who are working within care homes or the NHS, so I can’t give a commitment, but I can tell you that the home secretary is very carefully looking at that and the government wants to make sure we’re as sensitive and as flexible in our approach as we possibly can be. Do you want to come back with another one there, Matt?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Matt Foster: (42:24);That’s fine. Thanks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (42:24);Very good. And then finally Peter Madly from The Express and Star."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (42:31);Thank you, secretary of state. A question for the medical experts schools across the Westman and just starting to consider how things might look once they’re up and running again. The education secretary said today that schools will reopen in phases and clearly some form of social distancing will be required. Can you give us an idea of how you think social distancing will work in a school setting and do you envisage home education continuing for some pupils into next year?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (42:58);Secondly, a question for you, secretary of state. You mentioned repatriation flights before. There’s still thousands of British citizens stranded in India, particularly in the Punjab region, a lot from West Midlands and that area of the country in fact. The CTM charter team has said this week that more than 20,000 people have registered for flights from an Amritsar in the North, there’s only one flight every couple of days with a maximum capacity of 300 so people who are running out of money and medicine have been told it’s not possible to confirm when they’ll be able to get back. Now, do you have an idea of how many Brits are stuck in India, and are you planning to increase the number of repatriation flights from Northern cities so these people can return home?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (43:41);Well, thanks very much. And look, can I first of all say the incredible effort from the West Midlands where you’re reporting both the NHS care homes and frankly the people following the social distancing guidance, it’s made a massive difference. We follow the regional impact of all the measures that we’re putting in place and NHS capacity. And I know the West Midlands are putting an incredible shift. On repatriation flights, and just to give you a sense, we’ve already charted, so separate from the commercial flights, 58 returning more than 12,000 people from across South Asia."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (44:14);I can tell you that in recent days we’ve announced 28 more charter flights with the capacity to get around 77,000 more Brits back home. They’ll return home, that scheduling would be up until about May the seventh, they include 14 flights from India another nine from Pakistan, and five from Bangladesh. So we’re doing everything we can to get stranded Brits from the West Midlands and right across the country home. And as I’ve said in my earlier remarks, I think the foreign office and the department of transport and our missions abroad put in a heroic shift. But look, the jobs not yet done and as long as there are people that are in a predicament, we want to see what more we can do. I don’t know whether Jonathan or Yvonne wants to come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (45:01);Schools?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (45:02);Schools. Yes, please Jonathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (45:04);So I’ve got two sons, Alex and Theo at home, 11 and 12, and I know exactly how difficult it is for them wanting to go to school and the stress and strain that this is placing on people. But I’m absolutely clear that it was the right thing to do to close schools when we did and equally we now have to be very careful indeed about how we relax social distancing measures and when we do it and clearly there are multiple combinations of how one might think about that. I’m not going to go into those in detail because the scientific thinking is not yet complete or settled on those. It is still a matter of detailed daily and deliberation and study, and clearly as part of that relaxing schools is in the mix. Precisely how one would do that, I’m not going to comment further because I think there are multiple permutations that you can think of and we have to work through those carefully, one by one scientifically and get the best and the most optimized answer we can. So I wouldn’t want to make any premature comments about exactly how and to what extent schools are going to being involved in how we relax social distancing carefully, painstakingly and as and when we can with safety."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (46:34);Peter, is there anything else you’d like to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (46:37);Yes, Mr. Van Tam. If I can be a bit more direct with my question in that case, do you think it’s possible for groups of young people to stay two meters apart all day long in a school?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (46:48);I think that will be very difficult with a classroom of four year olds, five year olds. I think that will be really tricky. I think we have to think through all of those measures and how that might work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (47:00);Thanks very much Peter. I think we’ve now got a couple of questions from members of the public. We’ve got Matthew from Surrey who’s asking what has been done to ensure that visitors or returning citizens coming through British ports and airports are going into a 14 day quarantine and why hasn’t this been implemented before? I’ll turn to Yvonne to answer this, but we’ve looked at this regularly. I’ve asked this question actually quite a few times, and so far the advice has come back that actually it wouldn’t make any significant material difference to stopping the spread. It may become more relevant as we progress through this crisis and as we bear down on the transmission rates within the UK. But Yvonne, I don’t know if there’s anything you’d add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (47:50);Secretary of state, not very much. So Matthew, thank you. It’s a really interesting question and obviously as we move into a new phase over the coming months, it’s one that will come back again and the scientific advisory committee is looking at all of the measures that ports could and should perhaps do implement that would make a difference. That’s the important thing because otherwise we’re just disrupting everything for no particular gain and we have had some experience of it of course during the contained fees when we worked intensively with all the ports in Britain to ensure that we kept our citizens as safe as possible. And we’ve learned quite a bit from that. But there are a number of measures of which quarantine is one and it is being looked at."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (48:33);And of course as we keep the ports and the airports open for vital supply chains, that’s a consideration as well, but we’ll continue to keep that under review. I think there’s a second question which is coming up on the screen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Bob: (48:51);As there has been success so far in not overwhelming the NHS and there seems to be plenty of space in the Nightingale Hospitals, why can’t we remove some residents from care homes for their immediate safety? If this takes place immediately and perhaps with military assistance, this could save some lives. Is it feasible in any way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (49:14);Well, I’ll let Yvonne talk to the current situation. What I can say, it’s something that has been under constant discussion. Of course we want to make sure, and the Nightingale’s have been amazing and the military’s done a great job in supporting the NHS teams. We’ve got to make sure we’ve got the NHS capacities as we set out in our five principles for how we might move forward to the next phase that it’s not just there to deal with the current cases, but to deal with the future demands that may be put on the NHS, both in relation to the virus but also other health needs. But we’re looking at that, not least in the context of some of the cohorting that may need to be done, which hasn’t been done in some areas, some areas it has. So it’s certainly something that, again, remains under review. Yvonne, do you want to say a bit more on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (50:00);Thank you secretary of state and thank you Bob. So it is, and the Nightingale Hospitals, they operate on a number of different models and we’re looking at the difference between those models and whether they are adaptable to circumstances that may arise as we go forward, of which this would be one. And the issue about the home residence is that this has to be a humane solution for people and that it isn’t more damaging or harmful to have people move, particularly people who are already frail, vulnerable, maybe suffer from dementia. So it has to be looked at as a judgment in terms of what is the best thing to do for those people and what is the most humane intervention given the risk they may face. But it is certainly … It is something that is looked at and will be continued."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (50:46);It’s worth also just saying, Bob, that one of the pieces of learning that the cabinet office had from 2016, we looked at the lessons learned from the flu epidemic we had was that the shift of people out of the NHS and into the community, including care homes, was something that was important, which should be taken forward. But I understand your question. We’ve got to make sure all of these things are done safely, and that doesn’t mean that certain NHS facilities couldn’t be used in the way that you’ve described. So we’re looking at all of that. Thank you very much, Bob. Thanks everyone for all of your questions. And that brings to a close today’s Downing Street press conference. Thank you very much. (silence)."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","British officials gave a coronavirus briefing on May 1. Matt Hancock led the briefing and said the UK has delivered on its target to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests per day."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (00:12);Good afternoon and welcome once again to the Downing Street Daily Coronavirus Briefing. I’m joined by Professor John Newton who coordinates our work on testing and by Professor Steve Powis, who’s the medical director of the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (00:27);Every day we’re working through our plan to protect life and protect NHS by slowing the spread and building the capacity so at all times the NHS has got the capacity to give the very best care to everybody who needs it. In today’s briefing after setting out the daily statistics, I want to talk about testing. But beforehand, I’d like to share some really good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (00:58);Earlier this week I said that we are now able to begin the restoration of NHS services. Now, we’re past the peak, I can tell you about the next step, the restoration of fertility services. Few families have been untouched by the amazing advances in fertility treatments over past generation. And I know just how time sensitive fertility treatment can be and how important it is for the families affected, and I know that this treatment can change lives for better forever. When I say thank you to all of you, everybody watching, for staying at home to protect NHS, of course, I’m saying thank you on behalf of the lives that you’re saving, but I’m also saying thanks on behalf of the lives that the NHS can now once again help to create. Because together we’ve protected NHS, and we’re now restoring the NHS and restoring the chance for so many couples to start a family."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (02:15);Turning to the figures. 177,454 people have tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus and 27,510 people have now sadly died across all settings, an increase of 739. As one, we will remember them and treasure their memories. This is a virus that has a devastating impact on families, on friends, on local communities. Right across government, we’re working day and night to defeat it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (03:04);At the beginning of last month, at this podium, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test and that as a nation we should achieve 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month. I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet. I can announce that we have met our goal. The number of tests yesterday on the last day of April were 122,347. This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement, but it is not my achievement."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (03:57);It is a national achievement achieved by a huge team of people working together. And I tell you this, the testing capacity that we’ve built together will help every single person in this country. Testing is crucial to suppress the virus. I know from personal experience too, just how much people with symptoms want to know if they’ve got the disease. I know that I did. It helps remove the worry, it helps keep people safe and it will help us to unlock the lockdown. So many people have tragically died and the challenge we still face is vast, but we’re making real progress."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (04:43);I want to take a moment to thank and pay tribute to the incredible team who did this together and who joined in one of the greatest national mobilizations that we’ve seen. We brought together the best civil servants, the best minds from the private sector, the best scientists, the best lab technicians and the best of the best in the armed forces. Setting, stretching ambitious goals in a crisis has a galvanizing effect on everybody involved. It is a mission. If we hadn’t been so bold, if we’d chosen a safer, easier path, I just can’t see how we would have built the capacity that we need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (05:23);In a few short weeks, we’ve created a new test for the virus in PHE, we’ve built a network of regional testing centers, we’ve put a fleet of mobile testing units on the road, and created home testing kits so if you can’t get to the test, we can get the test to you. We’ve more than doubled the capacity of NHS Public Health England labs and created three brand new mega labs to analyze the results."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (05:52);So many people have played a part in this work: British diagnostic companies like Randox and Oxford Nanopore and Medical Wire and DNANudge, and Samba, logistic companies like the Royal Mail and Yodel who were brilliant and got us out of a real hole this week: academics like Professor Derek Crook and Sir John Bell from Oxford and Professor Ara Darzi from Imperial, Deloitte and Boots, who’ve delivered our drive through centers, AstraZeneca, GSK and Novacyte whose labs go on stream next week, Public Health England and the NHS, of course, who pulled out all stops, Professor Sharon Peacock, Professor John Newton and the UK Biocentre and the Crick, who sets up high tech laboratories. And also it wasn’t just a national effort, but from across the world, including ThermoFisher, Hologic, Abbott and Amazon from the US, Qiagen from Germany and Roche from Switzerland."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (06:50);And this is how we did it. Because everybody worked together with grit and determination to reach a shared goal, and they thrived because the team contained diversity of perspectives, of background and, critically, a diversity of thought. And when things went wrong, which they did every single day, believe me, we didn’t ask who we could blame, we asked how we could fit it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (07:19);So to my team. I want to say you toiled tirelessly night and day and I’m so proud of what you have achieved. And to all of you, on behalf of government, on behalf of the whole country, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (07:33);As prime minister said, a big increasing testing provides a way to unlock the puzzle of coronavirus. And testing forms the first element of our plan to test, track and trace. By mid-May, we’ll have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place. That work is underway as we speak. And if it needs to be bigger, we’ll scale it as required."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (07:57);The combination of contact tracers and new technology through our new COVID-19 NHS app will help tell us where the virus is spread and help everyone to control new infections. People will be able to know if they’ve been in close contact with someone who’s transmitting the disease and take the action that they need to."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (08:20);Our full-scale test, track and trace model will drive infection rate down, and the lower they are and the lower number of new infections, the more effective the country’s system will be. Tracing and tracing will allow us to get R down and hold R down, and so it will allow us to lift lockdown measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (08:45);Now this disease affects us all indiscriminately. We’ve seen that. In recent weeks, we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones, and yet our goal must be freedom. Freedom from the virus, yes, and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so. But also, we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too, each citizen’s right to do as they please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (09:18);For now, we’re working together to stay home. We’re impinging on the freedom of all, for the safety of all. With this next mission of test, track and trace. I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision, and so to reassert as much as is safely possible the liberty of us all. That is our next mission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (09:50);But for now the most important thing for everyone to do to keep R down and to get us all through this, is to maintain the spirit and the resolve that’s had such an impact thus far. So please, stay at home. Protect the NHS and save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (10:08);And now Professor Newton is going to set out some more details on testing and then I’m going to ask Professor Powis to set out and take us through the slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (10:20);Thank you very much, Secretary of State. And kind of also thank you on behalf of the program for those kind of thanks. It’s been a truly extraordinary collaboration, but thank you very much. We have reached an important milestone, but I want to explain why we need all this testing. Back in March, the country moved into lockdown because the virus was circulating widely, not because we did not have enough tests. Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase. And at that point, access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would have made no difference. The decision went of going into lockdown would have been the same and would have been taken at the same time. In the same way the risk out of lockdown has not being blocked by low levels of testing, we can relax social distancing only when the government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down. Testing will, as [inaudible 00:11:16] just mentioned, help to keep it under control once we’re out of lockdown, but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown down a day longer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (11:25);What about Germany? People talk about Germany a lot. But yes, Germany had a lot of tests available from the get go, but there was also a lot less virus around in Germany when they introduced social distancing and it was circulating in younger people. As CMO pointed out in an earlier briefing, we should not rush to the conclusions about relationships between numbers of tests available and the outcomes in different countries. Nevertheless, as CMO also said, we are all learning from other countries and we have learned from the experience of other countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (11:55);But back to the here and now, where’s all this leave us in the UK? Well, the 100,000 tests a day target set for two purposes. As Secretary of State has mentioned it was intended to motivate the program and set the scale of our ambition, and it has certainly done that. More importantly though perhaps, we knew from our calculations that we would need something like this level testing to be ready for the next phase of the response to the pandemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (12:21);Looking to the future then, we now have a very substantial and flexible testing capability in the UK. It will be used to drive extensive contract tracing, control any new infections, to help us keep patients and staff safe in hospitals and care services and tell us with some precision how the virus has spread across the country and is spreading in the future. If we can quickly identify who may have been in contact with someone infected, we can prevent them from passing it on and though drive down transmission rates of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (12:57);Now the NHS app for contact tracing is also in development and making rapid progress. The more people who sign up for the new app when it goes live, the better informed our responses will be and the more effective we will be in keeping the virus under control."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (13:13);All this progress with testing and with our design of the next phase of contact tracing and the app, frees ministers and their scientific advisors to choose whatever future strategies are best suited to keep the country safe. I can assure you that the test capability we have built in the last few weeks is world-leading in its scale and sophistication, and gives us the flexibility we need. As the pandemic evolves, we will have the testing capacity to meet changing demand across the country. It is now there to serve us all. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (13:50);Thanks very much, John. And Professor Powis, if you’ll take us through the slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (13:55);Thank you very much, Secretary of State, and good afternoon everybody. So as I and others have said on many occasions, the magnificent response of British public-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (14:03);… many occasions, the magnificent response of British public to the government’s request to comply with social distancing instructions, has meant that we have begun to get on top of this virus. We’ve seen the transmission rate, reproduction rate, fall to below one, and that means that the number of infections is falling within our communities and that means the pressure has been kept off the NHS. The NHS has responded magnificently to make sure that our patients have always had available the treatment they require. And over time, this also has impact on the unfortunate number of deaths that we’ve seen. As we move to the next phase of managing COVID-19, I think the first thing I’d like to do is to remind everybody of the five tests that the government has set for adjusting the current lockdown."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (14:53);The first, I’ve already referred to and that’s the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity to provide the critical care requirements that are needed but also specialist treatment right across the U.K."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:06);Secondly, it’s that sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus and we are beginning to see that, but we need to make sure that that is maintained."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:18);Thirdly, it’s reliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. And again, as I’ve said, it’s everybody’s efforts in complying with social distancing that means that infections have fallen and will continue to fall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:34);Fourthly, this has been a challenge, not just in the U.K. But globally around the operational response to a pandemic that includes PPE. It includes other things. And moving forward we to ensure that those challenges… Testing is one of them… are in hand and we are in a good position going forward to meet future demand."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:58);And finally and critically that any adjustments going forward, don’t risk a second wave or second peak of infections, that again runs a risk of overwhelming our health systems."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (16:12);So those are five key tasks that have been set and the government will be looking to confidence that it has met those before it moves to the next phase of the lockdown and the measures that we will need to take going forward to stay on top of this virus and ensure infection rates remain low."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (16:34);Now in the next slide we will provide, I’m providing some details of exactly how the public have complied. And the first is an example on how people have been approaching contact, particularly with vulnerable people over a period in middle part of April showing that 84%, the great majority of adults have said they either not left their home or only left the home from permitted reasons and 87% of adults avoiding contact with older or vulnerable people. So a great testament to the efforts that our British public have gone to, to ensure that we reduce infections. And on the right of this slide, some information on the number of people who’ve been working at home since social distancing issues were introduced and that’s 45% of adults in employment are saying that they work at home and compares to around 12% of last year. So again, a great increase in those that are not going up, that are staying at home and managing to work without having to go in their usual place of work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (17:42);And on the third slide, begin to see the testing information the Secretary of State said as both Secretary St. John have said, the number of tests increased dramatically, but it’s not just the fact the numbers have increased. It’s the fact that capacity is increased so that we can use testing for a far wider range of purposes and you have already heard some of the areas in which that is going to critical going forward in the months ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (18:11);In the fourth slide, we show new cases as determined by positive tests. You will see that that has increased a bit in recent days, but that should see it in the context of increased the number of tests in the round. So more testing and more testing of different groups of individuals is likely to bring more positive tests as a result. But overall I think the number relatively stable and that is a good sign and reflects that the level of infection is falling."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (18:44);The next slide then moved to people who unfortunately, and again it’s a mild illness for the majority of people, but for a proportion who do have to be admitted to hospital, you can see that since the middle of April, numbers of people in hospital with COVID- 19 have been falling and that’s particular marked in London. That was ahead in terms of the infection rate and therefore that all has come quickest in London. It is starting to move down maybe at a slower level in other regions of the U.K. But nevertheless overall the trend is downwards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (19:22);And then that also translates in the next slide to people who, again, small minority but important groups that have to be treated in our critical care facilities, this shows the proportion of people with COVID-19 in critical care beds. Again, that is falling in the four nations. And the absolute number of people in critical care beds, so not just the beds but the absolute number is also declining."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (19:49);And then finally we move unfortunately to deaths, the slide with deaths that occurred. Again, we’re not talking, we’re not doing deaths in all settings. We previously, up until a few days ago showing deaths in hospital settings. We’ve now expanded this. And again, you see those numbers do vary from day to day and there’s a reporting lag at the weekend, but over all the seven day rolling average, which smooths out those daily variation is showing that the number of deaths is beginning to trend downwards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (20:20);Then very finally, we show the usual international comparison against other countries. And again this comes with a usual caveat that this sort of comparison is really important. It’s now U.K all settings, but a real comparison is in all cause mortality. So in SAS stats in countries that is measured more consistently between countries, but there will be some time before that analysis can be done. So although it’s important to show the data, I think it’s important to remember that it will be a number of months and perhaps longer before we can see the true comparison between our countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (21:03);So finally to remind people that the hardships we’ve been going through, the compliance, social distancing is working. The key thing is it needs to continue to work. So all must continue to not think that this is over. This is really beginning, but it is translating into benefits in pressure on the NHS and on reduction in deaths. So it’s important that we all keep it up. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (21:27);Thanks very much Steve. So the first question is going to be from Andrew from Leeds who joins by video."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Andrew: (21:38);Hello. My question is when lockdown restrictions are lifted and schools open, will they find that people choose to keep their children out of school, even if it’s open for their age group? And also how will you make sure the public’s confident it’s safe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (21:53);Well thanks, Andrew. That’s a really important question. The, our aim is when it is safe to do so, then we’ll make recommendations of changes like this. But we will only do it when it’s safe to do so. So we are not going to reopen schools if it isn’t safe. Now of course this disease thankfully doesn’t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults. So it is much, much, much safer for children. And maybe Professor [Patz 00:00:22:35], you can add something on that. But we will not reopen until it’s safe to do so. So that’s on your second question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (22:42);The first question, of course, you know as in when we reopen schools, our goal is to get back to the norm, and the position as it was before. And I’m pretty, I’m confident that because we’ll only do it when it’s safe then it will at that point then be entirely reasonable and become normal again to send children to school."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (23:08);Yes, so I think it’s as they’ve said, it’s perfectly correct that this virus affects children much less than it does the elderly and older adults. So they are much less acted by the effects of having COVID-19. As we said the last time we were here, there have been some very rare reports about complications in children. We are continuing to look for that and try and understand if there is any link. But the overall message is for children, this is a mild disease or it produces very little symptoms. The science is still evolving in term of transmission between children. So we do need to be cautious as we think about opening schools. We will need to think carefully and advise governments appropriate advice as to how that might happen. But the key thing is that this is not a serious disease for the vast, vast, vast majority of children and indeed younger people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:10);In fact, it’s simple to remember, isn’t it, that the reason that we had to take the decision to close schools was because of the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (24:21);Exactly, exactly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:22);And that’s important to bear in mind and I hope reassuring, Andrew."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:26);The next question is from Stuart, from Redditch and Stewart asks, “Given the large investment that’s gone in creating the Nightingale Hospitals, will we make use of them going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists at the right time as we come through the pandemic?”"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:44);The answer to your question, Stuart, is that we will do what we need to do to reduce NHS waiting lists as we reopen the NHS. But the Nightingales were designed very specifically for patients who are intubated and therefore they were under anesthetic. So they are specifically designed for COVID, but Steve, you were behind that project so maybe you can speak to that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (25:12);Yes, the Secretary is quite right. The Nightingale Hospitals have been designed with specific purposes in mind. The Nightingale Center in East London was created in order to be used if we needed extra capacity for ventilated patients. Fortunately we have used the Nightingales in London, but fortunately we have matched that surge because of the combined efforts of the British public to maintain social distancing. So the NHS has done a great job. But those hospitals are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose and that doesn’t necessarily mean that they would be fit for purpose for other type of NHS activity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (25:56);Now of course we also need to keep them as an insurance policy in the next month or two because we need to be confident, as I said in the five tests that we, that we have sustained reduction in hospital admissions. But of course we will always keep things under review going forward. But I think the key thing is that the Nightingale’s have shown quite how agile the NHS can be with the support of the military if we need to be, but I think have given us that extra capacity that we have used but haven’t had to use to the extent that we might’ve feared even just at the beginning of April."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (26:33);Thanks very much, and thanks, Stuart, for submitting your question. Remember that you can submit a question by going onto gov.uk/ask and I think these questions from the public are a great addition to our daily briefings. We’ll now turn to questions from the media. First one is from you, Hugh [Pemm 00:26:56], of the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh Pemm: (26:58);Thank you so much, Secretary of State. As you said, there’s clearly been a rapid and impressive expansion of lab capacity and testing centers and businesses and staff have put in a huge effort and are fully deserving of praise. I wanted to ask a little more about where we go from here. In your view, you touched on it but a little more detail. How do you intend to further develop and expand the testing network as part of the moves to combat the virus?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (27:27);Well, that’s a really important question, Hugh. I’d like to set out a bit of it, but I think there’s two parts. First is that we’ve grown this testing capacity to do over a hundred thousand 122,000 tests done yesterday. And that’s for purpose because by testing you can help to treat patients better. The more we’ve been testing patients, you can help get people back to work and there’s been a big expression of the eligibility to get a test in order to be able to get back to work. And also for…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (28:03);… [inaudible 00:28:00] in order to be able to get back to work. And also for surveys and very soon we should get the first results of the surveys that are out in the field at the moment, so that we know how many people have the disease right across the country. And we should get those results very soon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (28:19);We plan to continue to expand capacity. As I said, there’s a new lab coming on stream next week that AstraZeneca GSK have put together at Cambridge. And we’ll keep going from there. But the other really important question is making sure we use this capacity in the best way possible. For instance, to have a real focus on care homes, to make sure that we can tackle the epidemic within care homes as well. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (28:53);Thank you, Secretary of State. Yes, so it is an extraordinary achievement to build this [inaudible 00:28:59] so quickly. There is an element of consolidation required now. We need to move to a more sustainable footing. And we also need to try and integrate work of the new laboratories with existing infrastructure. So, for example, making sure that the results flow back to general practitioners and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (29:14);So all of that is happening and that will really help us to use this new capacity to its maximum benefit. And then as Secretary says, there are a whole range of other opportunities to support the NHS, the care sector, and also other sectors, such as criminal justice, by making testing available. And I think a really exciting development is this rollout of testing at home, which of course will be very, very helpful for any contract tracing, a really flexible, fast way of getting tests to people when we’re using our contact tracing, track and trace, and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (29:50);So we’re very pleased with what we’ve done so far, but it really is only a start. We do need to apply what we have now to the challenges of the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:03);Thank you-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (30:03);Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:04);… very much. Yeah, have you got a follow-up, Hugh? Was that …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh: (30:05);Just one more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:06);Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh: (30:06);Can you ensure that health and care workers do get priorities-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:10);Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh: (30:10);… so can get tested when they need to be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:12);Yes, absolutely. This is really important. And within the system that we built, if health care workers need a test, then get one as a priority either through the NHS itself and the NHS’s own labs, or through the employer route so they can essentially go to the front of the queue in terms of getting an appointment to one of the drive through centers. And that’s an important part of making sure we have the right prioritization. We’ve always talked about the prioritization starting with patents and then people in the NHS, then [inaudible 00:30:51] workers and then the general public. And that prioritization is built into the system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:56);Just to build on this point of testing for contact tracing, thing is once we have contact tracing in large scale, then you want to be able to test people as soon as possible so that you know if there’s a positive test so that the people that have been in close contact with can be advised to act accordingly and isolate so that they don’t pass on the disease. So that is a very important other new part of the priority within testing once we get that up and running by the middle of the month. Thanks, Hugh. Sam Coates from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Sam Coates: (31:36);Matt Hancock, the 122,000 tests has obviously increased in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday, but haven’t actually been yet returned and analyzed by lab? Because earlier in the week, number [inaudible 00:31:52] was indicating that they wouldn’t count against the target, but now it does seem as if they do. To John Newton, perhaps this morning we got the news that we’ve been waiting for, that you cannot get coronavirus a second time. That seems to have come out of a study from the South Korea Central Clinical Committee for Emerging Disease Control. How much weight do you put on that seemingly important study and Steve [inaudible 00:32:15], so I was interested that you were seeming to be quibbling with a colleague at Public Health England, Dr. Okereke, who was saying yesterday that children don’t seem to be able to transmit the disease. Was she wrong?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (32:29);Right. Well, a feast of questions. I’ll hand over to Dawn to answer the precise numerical questions. We sat out on gov.UK exactly how we count the different types of tests for different reasons because obviously, exactly as you said the question, home tests are produced in a different way to the tests at drive through centers. So John can take us through the exact breakdown of the 122,347 tests yesterday. I’d just add that in total, we now, over the entire testing program since the test was invented, have done over a million tests. Now 1,023,824. So that’s another benchmark that we’ve managed to reach. John and then I’ll ask Steve to answer the question about the transmissability of disease amongst children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (33:27);Thank you, Secretary of State. So the NHS Public Health England’s laboratories, including the laboratories in other countries, all four countries of the UK, undertook 39,753 tests between them, of which the were 2,537 in Scotland, 1,019 in Wales, and 1,319 in Northern Ireland. And it’s worth mentioning, we have a partnership with Roche and that partnership, they undertook 13,703 tests. So that a benefit of the public private partnerships. The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse Laboratories total 79,522. Now, of those 39,153 were undertaken in the drive through centers or by mobile units or in fact by research nurses who administered tests as part of the Office [inaudible 00:34:21] Statistics Survey."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (34:23);Your question, the home kits delivered, there were 27,497 kits delivered and there were 12,272 tests delivered through the satellite process. And then on the surveillance testing, which is a different, which is the antibody testing, there were 3,072 tests undertaken. And so that’s the breakdown of the total 122. So your question was about home kits, 27,000 and then there were 12,000 more that were sent out a satellites."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (35:01);Thanks very much. Steve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Powis: (35:03);Thanks, [inaudible 00:35:04]. So on the question of transmission in children. I’ll say what I think the position is. John, with his public health expertise, will correct me if I get any of this wrong. I think if a child or a young person is symptomatic, then there’s no reason to think that they wouldn’t transmit the virus in the way that any other person who’s symptomatic would be. I think the big question is how many children don’t have symptoms, but get virus? And in that particular case or in those cases, how transmissible is the virus between them? And I think that is data that we are still accumulating, an evidence that we are still learning about. And of course it is one of the key questions when it comes to schools and how schools are opened again. So I think the true answer is that the evidence is still emerging over the transmitability of virus in children that don’t show symptoms. But John, is that your understanding?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (36:02);Yes, absolutely. And shall I pick up the question on immunity? Can you get the [inaudible 00:36:08]-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Powis: (36:07);Yes, [crosstalk 00:36:09]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (36:07);… twice. So you mentioned a study, the science on immunity is still emerging and I think the general rule is that you would never make a decision from a single study. So we would very much want to see that result replicated in other studies before we decide that that was really the case."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (36:27);But it’s obviously promising. I think people have said before in these briefings it would be very surprising if there was no immunity after an infection, but at the moment I think the science is still not precise about how much immunity you get and how long it lasts. So, but nevertheless results such as the one mentioned are encouraging."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (36:47);Thanks very much Sam. Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Victoria Macdonald: (36:50);Thank you, Secretary of State. Can I just say that I’m not quite sure that Sam’s question was answered. There was a report in the HSJ that previously test would be counted only once the sample had been processed, but that that testing is now changed, that it’s being counted once it’s been posted out. Is that the case? And then Secretary of State, I wanted to ask you specifically, the OS figures today show that you are twice as likely to die from COVID-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country. What is your reaction to that and what policy implications does that have for you?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (37:29);Yeah, I’ll ask John to answer the point from the HSJ, but it’s not something I recognize. The point on deprivation and the point that in more deprived parts of the country that it appears to be a greater impact. This is something that we are worried about and looking at and we’re looking at it in the context of all of the different ways in which this disease seems to have a different impact on different groups. So right from the start we’ve known that it has a much more serious impact on older people, it appears to have a bigger impact on men, it appears to have a bigger impact on people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, it’s appears that people who are obese are more seriously affected by the disease, and there’s also this a new evidence from the Office for National Statistics of the correlation with deprivation. So we are looking all of these things and trying to understand the impact of the virus as much as we possibly can as and when we get new evidence. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (38:50);Yeah. So there’s been no change to the way tests are counted. As we develop new ways of delivering tests, we’ve taken advice from officials as to how they should count it. So the tests that are within the control of the program, which is the great majority, are counted when the tests are undertaken in our laboratories. But for any test which goes outside the control of the program, they’re counted when they leave the program. So that’s the tests that are mailed out to people [inaudible 00:39:18], the tests that go out in the satellites. So that’s the way they are counted, have always been counted and the way we were advised to count them by officials."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (39:27);And that’s all set out on gov.UK. Sam Lister from the [inaudible 00:11:32]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Sam Lister: (39:35);Thank you, Health Secretary. [inaudible 00:39:38] have been raised about how the over 70’s have been treated as [inaudible 00:39:42] in this crisis, including by senior figures in your party. Can you reassure over 70’s who are fit and healthy, that they’ll be treated exactly same as the rest of the population when lockdown measures are eased? And also it’s been made clear today that this is not over, but now we are past the peak people will obviously rightly be hopeful that they can start making plans to see family and friends again, perhaps even have a holiday, or meet up to go and have a holiday together. Is late summer a realistic timescale for this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (40:20);Well, so the last question is very tempting to speculate at, but unfortunately we just don’t know. It’s still too early to say. I’m really sorry to have to give that answer, but it is. The five tests we’ve set out are there partly to try to give everybody a sense of when we’ll be able to make those next decisions that I know people are yearning for. But we will only lift the lockdown measures when safe to do so. This is why test, track, and trace is so important because it will help us to do that. It isn’t necessary to put that in place, but it helps enormously. But it is as of today too soon, and hence the message remains to stay at home because that protects the NHS and saves lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (41:16);And on your first point about the over 70’s, maybe Steve, I can ask you to answer, but we were always clear from the start. There’s a very specific group who we’ve been in contact with who we’re asking to shield, which is ensure that they have as little of contact as possible with other people for their own health reasons. And after that the question is a degree, a gradation of the [inaudible 00:13:44]. Steve?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Powis: (41:45);Yes, so of course we know, as you know, that that the over 70’s can be absolutely fit and healthy and that it’s not the case that everybody over 70 has a chronic health condition or an underlying disease. As the Secretary of State said-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (42:03);… or an underlying disease. As the Secretary of State said, we very specifically asked a group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, but not everybody, to shield and to do everything they could to stay at home, because we knew that their underlying conditions put them more at risk of serious complications from COVID-19. So that’s the group that are being shielded. Of course, everybody is combined with social distancing measures at the moment, being asked to stay at home whatever age you are. So in the generality at the moment, everybody is in that same boat of complying with those measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (42:38);I think as we look forward, and as I said at the very start, the government moves to another combination of measures, including track and trace, that will help us keep the infection under control going forward. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable question to say, how would that work in age groups and age bands. Although we do know the complications, and unfortunately deaths, are more common in the elderly, even without complications, I think that’s a consideration, and that’s work, I think, that we will need to do as we move forward. But I think your point is very well met."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (43:20);Thanks very much, Sam. Allan Preston from the Belfast Telegraph."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Allan Preston: (43:26);Good afternoon. I just have two quick questions for the health secretary. Knowing Allan, the impact of coronavirus has not been quite as severe compared to the rest of the UK due to factors like a lower population density, do you think there’s any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace to other parts of the UK? My second question, as far as does not respect borders, do you think it would be better for Stormont work on an all-Ireland basis in fighting the pandemic rather than following UK lead?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (44:02);Well, thank you. The thing is, that across the UK, the level of the virus has been different in different parts of the country. We saw that in the chart earlier that in London the level’s been much higher, and other parts of the country lower. But what’s interesting is that the shape of the curve rise, and then the fall in the virus that’s just started has been basically the same throughout the country. So that means that moving together, I think it was the right approach at the start, and I can see the case that could be made, and of course, the decisions that are devolved with respect, the devolution settlement. But ultimately, if you look at the shape of the curve, getting our down and getting a level of new cases right down, that’s happened in the UK together. Of course the relationship with the Republic is important as well, and we have good relations in terms of political level, but also at a medical level and conversations with the Republic with the decisions that they take. We have very intensive discussions within the UK about the timing of changes within the country. Thanks very much. Steve Ford from the Nursing Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Ford: (45:30);Good afternoon, Nursing Time survey. As indicated, almost all nursing staff have been more stressed and anxious than usual. The third described the state their mental health is bad during the COVID-19 crisis for reasons including PPA shortages. So my question is, what are you going to do in the long-term to protect the mental health of nurses, other staff, on top of the help lines that have already been announced, as we already have a well-documented nurse shortage. I hope you’d agree that we can’t afford to lose any more in the coming months. And secondly, what’s your message to black and minority ethnic staff who feel they may have been put at great risk given the emerging evidence from the mortality data?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (46:11);Thank you very much, Steve. I think that the way that nurses across the HS have risen to this challenge has been admirable. The bravery and the flexibility that nurses have shown right across the NHS. I think that’s something the whole country recognizes it, and I recognize it as health secretary. I think that certainly the measures that we have put in place to help people with stress and more serious mental health as a result of work, those measures are important, and I’m very glad that they are place. I’ve been trying to get them in place for some time, and we’ve managed to put in place very quickly as the crisis began. But the other thing that is undoubtedly true when you talk to nurses on the front line, the decrease in the number of nurses, so that there are more to do the work that’s needed is a really important part of the part of the plan. As you know, we committed in the election to 50,000 more nurses by the end of parliament. We remain committed to that. In fact, we’ve seen more nurses come into the NAS over the autumn, and then also as a direct result of the appeal for nurses who’d left the profession to come back. So we have got more nurses in back into the NHS, and I want to support and cherish every single nurse who works in the NHS because of the important work that they do. So I’m sure that will be a big conversation as we restore the NHS and thank everybody for the work that they’ve done during the difficulty of coronavirus. Steve, I don’t know if you to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (48:06);I think your point, again, is a very good point. Of course, it’s not just nurses as you pointed out yourself. It’s all staff. There’s been a tremendous effort by staff across the NHS. They have been working incredibly hard, sometimes in different areas from where they usually work. Of course that brings its own stresses. I know talking to the chief execs and the medical director, executives, medical directors of many of our hospital trusts across the country that as we begin to now stand up some of the services that we have had to take down to manage the surge in coronavirus patients, those leaders locally are thinking very hard about how these support staff, because they absolutely recognize that they have gone through a very challenging, and at times very stressful number of weeks. That support is required both in the short-term and over a longer period of time to ensure as we move back towards a normal, that we can be back to normal while still have COVID, but back towards normal, that staff have the support they need. So I think the comments you’ve made are very much reflected in the comments I hear from all leaders across the health system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (49:21);Maybe you could answer Steve’s second question as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (49:24);Second question, sorry. The second question, just remind me the second question was, Steve?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Speaker 3: (49:29);About the minority."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Ford: (49:30);Right, yes. Message for black and minority ethnics staff?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (49:34);Yes, and John might want to answer to some of this as well. I think the message for our black and minority staff is that we absolutely recognize, as secretary said earlier, that this virus is disproportionately affecting staff. I absolutely know the concern, the worry amongst our colleagues in those groups, and I’ve been talking to them over the last few weeks, as I’m sure were Secretary and others have. So there are things that we do in terms of supporting staff and helping them through the concerns that they have. I think there’s another piece of work that John will be able to talk about, which is to understand why it is, and secretary touched on this a little bit earlier, why it is that the virus seems to be disproportionately affecting members of staff and the population, the whole from particular ethnic groups. So that work is ongoing in public health. I think maybe John will be able to say a little bit, because of course, that will also inform what we need to do and the approach we need to take going forward. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John: (50:38);Thank you. As you know, then the statistics do show increased rates with some ethnic backgrounds. They’re relatively small, and they need to be looked at, although very important. But we do to also look at some of the other aspects of the virus. For example, the virus is present at different rates in different parts of the country, and we know that different parts of the country have very different people from different backgrounds. So we look at all of these figures together to try and understand what’s really going on, and that there is a cause for concern definitely. We are talking to NHS England about any advice that should be given based on the data. But there is also an important bit of statistical work to be done trying to understand what the real underlying risks are. Sometimes it can be wrong to take these statistics at face value."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John: (51:39);We also know that, unfortunately, some ethnic groups have different levels of ongoing health conditions. So for example, people from Asian background tend to have more diabetes. So we’re trying to look at, to an extent, those factors might be there as well. But it’s a very important issue. One, a number of people are looking at, Public Health England, but also a number of university groups are also studying this, and we’re feeding the results back to NHS England so that staff can get right advice as you can accurately, as you say."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (52:08);But I think it’s important for us to emphasize that we don’t need to wait for that data. That data and analysis is important, but we don’t need to wait for that to provide additional support. In fact, when Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS wrote out to our healthcare organizations, to hospitals, this week, he made a specific point of ensuring that the local health care leaders who pay particular attention to supporting and do whatever they feel is necessary locally to support our BME colleagues. I know, from even today, talking to some of those local leaders that they are absolutely doing that and providing that support."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (52:50);Thanks very much, Steve. Does that answer your question?"

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (00:00);Before I do that, I just want to remind you of what we’re trying to achieve. Our plan is to slow the spread and to protect the NHS so that the NHS is always there for you and your family whenever you need it, whether for Coronavirus or anything else. That goal is working. The number of spare critical care beds in the NHS is 3,413. On the latest figures, there have been 1,291,000 tests for Coronavirus including 85,186 tests on Sunday, yesterday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (00:43);190,584 people have now tested positive for Coronavirus, an increase of 3,985. 13,258 people are in hospital with Coronavirus and 28,734 people have died. That’s across all settings, an increase of 288. That figure is lower than at any point since the end of March. But as with testing, these reported figures tend to be lower over the weekend, so we do expect that number to rise. And remember, this is not just a number, but it is a constant insistent reminder that we must go further and faster in our national effort in dealing with this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (01:42);Over the last month, we’ve built a national testing infrastructure capable of over 100,000 tests a day. Today the capacity stands at 108,000. This means we’re now in a position to start implementing the next part of our plan, track and trace. The aim of test, track and trace is to hunt down and isolate the virus so it’s unable to reproduce. And crucially test, track and trace allows us to take a more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease. Creating this system is a huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity. We’ve already taken Britain’s small but brilliant diagnostics industry and taken it to global scale."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (02:32);We’re building an army of human contact tracers who can man the phones and find the contacts and support people. And of course we’re developing the contact tracing app which can help us deliver test, track and trace on the mass scale that we need across the country. The app, which takes full consideration of privacy and security, has already been tested in closed conditions at an RAF base. And today I can announce the next steps. From tomorrow, we will begin to pilot test, track and trace on the Isle of Wight starting with health professionals and rolling out this week to all citizens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (03:13);I’m grateful to the huge enthusiasm shown by islanders who know that by participating in this pilot, they’re at the forefront of helping get Britain back on her feet. Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows. The island has a single NHS trust, one local authority with the responsibilities for public health, a relatively low number of COVID cases and because it’s an island, we can run this trial in proper, scientifically controlled conditions comparing the effect with what’s going on on the mainland before we roll it out to the rest of the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (03:53);So here’s how it’ll work. Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island. From tonight, the contact tracing capability will go live and then tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. And from Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be asked to install the app. Once you’ve installed the app, it’ll start logging the distance between your phone and other phones with an app nearby."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (04:29);It’s been designed with a form of Bluetooth that conserves power so the app won’t drain your battery, and this log of proximity information will then be securely stored on your phone. If you become unwell with COVID symptoms, you inform the NHS via the app. All the app users who you’ve had significant contact with in the last few days will then be sent an alert by the NHS along with advice about what to do. A test ordering function will then be built in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (05:04);If you’re watching this and you live on the Isle of Wight, I have a simple message. Please, download the app to protect the NHS and save lives. By downloading the app, you’re protecting your own health, you’re protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community. I know the people of the Isle of Wight will embrace this with enthusiasm because by embarking on this project and by embracing test, track and trace, you will be saving lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (05:43);The pilot is important so we can help make sure the app works as well as it possibly can alongside the contact tracing system. And with your help, we’ll learn a lot. We’ll use it to make things better and we want to hear from you. I want to stress, and this is really important, that this trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight or anywhere else for that matter. We will only change the social distancing rules once our five tests are met. So I’ll end with the instruction that we all know. Please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Or if you live on the Isle of Wight, stay at home, install the app, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now turn to Professor Van-Tam to take us through the day’s charts. Jonathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (06:40);Thank you secretary of state. So let’s begin again with refreshing the five tests that we have in place for deciding if we’re going to adjust the lockdown. The first is around NHS capacity and we’re in a good position on that one. The second one is about a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus and it is now very clear in the data that we are past the peak. The next one is solid information that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. This is an indicator that we need to keep a close eye on over the next few days and weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (07:33);The fourth one is around operational challenges around testing and PPE and being able to meet future demand. There are continuing challenges on PPE. It is an absolute priority to continue pushing on this to get it right in the long-run. But of course on testing as you’ve heard from the secretary of state, we’re in a very good position. And finally we have to be confident that the adjustments we contemplate are not going to risk a second peak of infections. And this is really a matter of deep scientific discussion, very, very close following and absorbing of the evidence and one that we’re keeping under detailed scientific review as the days and weeks go by. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (08:28);Now this slide actually shows search data of people looking at Apple Maps for directions over driving, over walking routes or over using public transport. It tells the same story as slides you have seen before about how since we announced these social distancing measures, the public continue to observe the instructions to work with us to protect the NHS and get case numbers down. And you can see very, very consistent trends over reduced searches for driving instructions, walking instructions and use of public transport. So, we need to keep going. Let’s keep going and continue to drop the curve further. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (09:25);This is a graph showing from the 6th of April through to the 4th of May daily tests completed for Coronavirus. You can see on the right hand side the latest data showing 85,000 tests completed on the 4th of May. Our capacity is 108,000 tests and there is another lab opening next week. This is all very encouraging. Tests are going up, people are using testing services more and we are well within our capacity capability. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:10);Now this slide shows new cases of Coronavirus in the UK. From the 21st of March, you can see that obvious peak up to a high level in early April. And then you can see the pattern that has occurred in terms of new cases right up until the 4th of May. On this one, I have to say that new cases need to come down further. We have to continue to track this index and we have to get cases lower."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:47);If you look to the next slide please, here we array the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 from 17th of March through to the 3rd of May. And after peaks in the middle of April, you can see that in almost all areas now there are steady but absolutely consistent declines occurring. Possibly in a small number of areas, the trend is somewhat flat, but overall there are now steady declines in the number of people in hospital. This is good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (11:26);Following on please, the next slide. Critical care beds, ICU beds. Here again across all four nations you can see largely continuing declines and possibly a more important point, if you look at the axis on the left of the slide, the Y axis, you can see where we are in terms of capacity and there is plenty of ICU capacity which is extremely good. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (11:56);I turn now to deaths in all settings. Here you can see that there is a slow but consistent decline. You will see the weekend effect very clearly, especially if you look at the three steps on the right hand side of the chart. Fewer deaths are actually recorded, reported at the weekends. That’s an artifact of the way people report deaths. But overall if you look at the orange line, the seven-day smoothed out rolling average, there is this slow but consistent decline which is absolutely going in the right direction now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (12:36);And then the final slide is one we have shown for some time showing a comparison across countries dating back to the day when 50 cumulative deaths were recorded in each of the countries and we’re now quite a way across the slide to 60 odd days in some of the countries. The message is the same as I’ve said to you before that there are kind of three broad trends on this curve, but I do want to emphasize to you these are numbers, they are not rates."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (13:13);They do not adjust for the size of the underlying population, and this is a difficulty in interpreting these data. We will in the course of time be able to get all-cause, age-adjusted, excess mortality for many of the countries on this slide. And that will give us a much clearer understanding of what is going on. And hopefully those data will continue for a long period of time so that we can understand the fullness of the picture as we try to beat this virus. I will stop there with the data and hand back to the secretary of state."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (13:50);Thank you very much Jonathan. And we’re now going to take questions. And the first question is from a member of the public. We have a video from Zack Lane from London."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Zack Lane: (14:02);What is being done to ensure that BAM key workers are not disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and what steps have been taken to provide support to the families of those victims who have sadly passed away?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (14:19);Thank you, Zack Lane, an incredibly important question, two incredibly important questions, both of which we’re working hard to address. And I’m going to ask Jonathan to set out the details, but what I’d say absolutely from the start is that we recognize that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away, especially amongst care workers and those in the NHS. And I paid tribute to them before and I will do so again because the NHS is an amazing organization that has been built on the dedication of people from all backgrounds and this including many, many who’ve come to this country to give their lives working in the NHS and disproportionately employs people from ethnic minority backgrounds, and yet we have seen this impact in the data. And I think it’s affected a lot of us working on it to see that, and so we’ve got a lot of work going into fully understand scientifically and make sure that in every single case we learn what we can to protect people better."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (15:44);In terms of support for the families of those who’ve passed away, for those working in the NHS, we now have a program of support that we’ve been able to put in place that is there for everybody who is from a family where somebody has died whilst in service, including across pharmacy, across social care, and so I think that’s a really important thing for us to do, to recognize the sacrifice of those who put themselves at risk by going to work in what can be dangerous conditions where they might be working with those who have COVID-19. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:31);Yes. I’m extremely sorry whenever I hear of a healthcare worker death due to coronavirus, whether it’s someone from a black and minority ethnic group or otherwise. It doesn’t change the fact that it takes courage to work in the NHS at a time like this and it’s most difficult."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:55);On the subject of the signal that we have so far on black and minority ethnic groups, I want to say to you that we are taking it incredibly seriously. There is a very big piece of scientific work now ongoing that will report to the Chief Medical Officer and we’ll get to the bottom of this however long it takes us. But I will also say that this is a complicated picture because when you start to study patterns of disease across different ethnic groups, you also have to take into account potential differences in the age structure between groups, also differences in the patterns of underlying medical conditions, which we know do vary by ethnic group and therefore it’s a complicated picture. And also deprivation has to be taken into account where people live. And all of this is complex, it takes time and I’m not going to rush the answer. I think we owe it to minority ethnic groups to get this right and get a clear signal for you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (18:11);And you’ll have worked out that I’m from an ethnic minority group and we will get to the bottom of this. It could be that professor Newton has some further epidemiological granularity he’d like to add on this point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (18:25);Thank you, Jonathan. Well, just to say that we are, as you say, looking at the data very carefully, not just on ethnicity but also on age, sex and other factors such as obesity, which we know do have an impact on the effect of coronavirus. But it’s already clear from some of the published data that the impact in BME groups is greater, that there are more people with the infection and those who have the infection have worse outcomes in many cases. So there is already cause for concern, but as Jonathan says, it’s not entirely clear how much of that is due to different levels of underlying conditions or other risk factors. So there is work to be done and we will be publishing this as soon as it’s ready."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (19:03);Thank you very much. Thank you, Zack Lane. The next question is from Conrad from Ashford. And Conrad asks, “Going forward, will the primary aim of test, track and trace be to squash the occurrence of COVID-19 infection to very low levels or simply to flatten the curve enough that the NHS is not overwhelmed?” And that is a really important question, Conrad. The answer is that test, track and trace will help us to get the R down and to get the number of new cases down and to keep it down, but not on its own. It’s primarily the social distancing measures that we’ve taken so far that have flattened the curve and now we can see that the curve is going down from the presentation that professor Van-Tam just gave. The goal is to keep the number of new infections going down and bring in the test, track and trace."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (20:01);We’re at a point, which we will do from tomorrow in the Isle of Wight and then rolling out to the rest of the country, we will get those numbers down, the test, track and trace becomes more effective the lower the number and then we want to keep the number going down by keeping the R below one, the rate of infection. So our goal is not simply to flatten the curve, it is to get the occurrence of COVID-19 infections to very low levels, to be absolutely clear within your question that that is the answer. Thanks very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (20:41);We’ll now take questions from the media. Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Hugh Pym: (20:47);Thank you very much. When will you have recruited your 18,000 contact traces and when will the full test, track and trace network be up and running?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (20:59);The aim is to have the whole thing up and running by the middle of this month. We’re starting already. We’ve already started the recruitment. Of the 18,000 we have thousands already recruited and we are making very rapid progress, not only in the recruitment but also the training that’s necessary, a short piece of training. And we have enough to get going on the Isle of Wight. In fact, they came on stream as of five o’clock this evening so that’s up and running now, and then to roll out across the country. But there’s no magic around the 18,000 figure. That is the initial scale that we think is necessary. If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that’s in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is, the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests, then we’ll adjust that figure. That’s the initial goal, but it’ll be up and running by the middle of the month."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Hugh Pym: (22:08);Can I ask one more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (22:09);Of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Hugh Pym: (22:11);On business, some businesses will be required to have PPE for their staff, where will they procure it and will they be in competition with the NHS?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (22:20);Well, this is a really important important question when we consider changes to the social distancing measures. The wider impact of changes to social distancing measures, including for instance on PPE, on the first call on PPE must go to the NHS and social care and those other essential services who need it to keep the people delivering those services, safe. So that is something that we take into account. It’s in our five tests, but it is something that we’re working very hard on now. Of course, it’s our job in running the health and social care system to ensure that those areas and the other public services have PPE, and there’s a worldwide shortage as you say, so we do need to take that into consideration before making changes. And that’s why it’s one of the five tests. Thanks very much. Tom Clark from ATV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (23:27);Thank you, Secretary of States. The most successful contact tracing efforts around the world, like those of Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, were only partly reliant on mobile phone technology in order to work. They were more aligned on large numbers of volunteers on the community level going out to track down and trace cases at a huge scale. Has the government ensured this capacity is in place in the UK or are we putting too much faith in call centers and in untested digital technologies [crosstalk 00:24:02] may be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (24:04);It’s a really important point and I agree with the points in the question, which is that it isn’t just about the technology and the people in call centers, it’s also about citizens acting in the right way, acting in the right way to download the app because that protects you and protects your family and protects the NHS, but also acting in the right way to do contact tracing yourself. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (24:29);Yeah, so it’s a really good point, well made. The app is very exciting and the app adds something extra, it adds an automated response that can be almost immediate. But as you say, the program that we’re putting in place is an integrated program with the app, but also with contact tracing driven by testing. So access to testing partly through the app, but also other routes to the test. And then the test result backed up by contact tracing driven by public health professionals. At one level we’ve got public health England, but also a lot of experience on the ground with directors of public health and local authorities, environmental health officers who are very expert in this exactly as you say, shoe-leather epidemiology out on the streets, finding contacts."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (25:11);But even actually as what people call traditional contact tracing isn’t very traditional anymore. It’s quite highly technical. So we’ve developed a web based support, the contact tracing and advisory service, which has been ramped up to support this, and there’s also another line of defense through the telephone call center. So it’s a multi- layered approach. And one of the points of the Isle of Wight test, pilot, is to try and see how those different elements integrate together to support each other. So it’s a very good point, we are learning from the best practice around the world, but we also have something to offer in the UK as well because we’ve been doing this for a long time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (25:48);Thanks, Tom. I hope that answers your question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (25:51);Yes. I may have a quick follow question. Are we caught in something of a catch 22 with contact tracing? As I understand it, the numbers of cases have to fall quite a bit more before we can reliably roll it out across the country, but if we keep locked [inaudible 00:12:07], which we have to until your fifth test is met, it’s quite hard to pilot contact tracing because most of us are trying to isolate ourselves as much as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (26:19);No is the short answer. And the slightly longer answer is that even with social distancing measures, there still are some new cases that means that the technology can still be effective. And even with the scale of new cases across the country, contact tracing can still have an impact and the app will still be highly effective. It’s just more effective the fewer the number of new cases. So these are all matters of degree rather than absolute. So we’re not caught in a catch 22, but it is absolutely true that the social distancing measures, all the thing that is doing there, having the big impact. And so hence the message remains, stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. Unless you’re in the Isle of Wight. But even in the Isle of Wight, you should still stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. It’s that you should also install the app because that will help this to be yet more effective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (27:35);One final point on this, which is the Isle of Wight has a slightly lower rate of new COVID infections than some other places in the country and therefore actually is a … That makes it a good place to test this. Not only is it good because it will help the Isle of Wight, but it is also good because it has that slightly lower number of new infections."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (28:01);There’s lockdown measures until-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (28:03);… contact tracing is up and running across the country?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (28:07);No. The two aren’t necessarily linked like that. We haven’t said that we can’t make changes before it’s up and running. It’s just that the test, track, and trace system will help us to get R down and hold R down. And the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be. But we haven’t made a concrete link that your question drew between having this system in place nationally and making changes to the social distancing measures. There isn’t a necessary link between the two. They do work in tandem. The next question is from Oliver Dyer from Isle of Wight Radio."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Oliver Dyer: (28:54);Evening, all. In a poll that Isle of Wight Radio ran today, 80% of our listeners said they would install this new app. But the Island has a higher than average elderly population who fall into the government’s vulnerable category. How are you expecting those who don’t have a smart phone or can’t use that technology, be it on the Island or across the country, to get behind this. And with that in mind, considering the Island has an elderly population, one of the questions our listeners wants to know is, why the island is being chosen over other U.K. islands or locations?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (29:26);So, look, that’s a great set of questions, Oliver. And I’m really, really pleased to hear that 80% of people said that they would download the app. Because the more people who download the app, the more effective it’s going to be because you need two people having downloaded the app for it to be effective, for one to be able to tell the other that they’ve been in close contact with somebody who’s got symptoms of COVID-19. So, I’m really pleased that the people of the Isle of Wight have responded today in this way. I had a feeling that they would. And I’m really glad that they have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (30:01);But, partly because of the challenges that you set out, that not everybody has a smartphone, that’s another reason actually to test it in the Isle of White. Because, if we tested it somewhere where it would be easy, we wouldn’t find as many of the challenges, rather than testing it somewhere where you’ve got to have the technology, but you’ve got to have the human contact tracing as well. They go hand in hand. They help each other. And so, that is actually one of the things we thought about before choosing the Isle of Wight as the place to go first. John, do you?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (30:43);Yeah. Thank you. I mean, I think the Isle of Wight is an ideal place to do this. It’s quite a large population and there is a benefit in the fact that travel on and off the Island is relatively restricted. The ferries are there but they’re running relatively infrequently. So it is an ideal place to look at the epidemiology and see the impact. And it’s also, I used to be the regional director of Public Health for South Central, including the Isle of Wight. I know that the Island is very well equipped to respond to things like this. It’s a very coherent group. We’ve had tremendous support from the local authority, from the NHS, from the local MP. And, like everybody else, I think is going to be a great success as a pilot."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:22);Your point about elderly people, firstly we shouldn’t make assumptions. I mean, quite a lot of elderly people that are extremely tech savvy and quite happy to use smartphones. But we’ve also recognized that there are other ways of doing contact tracing. So, as I mentioned, we’ve built in a number of routes. So, people don’t have to have the app in order to benefit. But, of course, we will all benefit. If the app and the contact tracing drives down the infection rate, it drives down the infection rate for everybody."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:48);And I think the third point to say is that the people who are most mobile and most likely to be out bumping into each other are also the people who are probably most likely to be using smartphones. So, I think, all in all, we think it’s a strong program. And we’re looking forward to see how it works in the Isle of Wight. And that survey is extremely encouraging. So, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (32:07);Does that answer your questions, Oliver?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Oliver Dyer: (32:09);It does. Yeah. Am I allowed one more followup?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (32:11);Go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Oliver Dyer: (32:12);Fantastic. So, obviously, whilst a lot of people, a lot of Isle of Wight Radio listeners in particular have been positive about the app, there are some concerns that the lockdown measures could be lifted here early to form part of that trial. Could lock down on the Isle of Wight be lifted earlier than the rest of the U.K.? And, if so, is it safe to do so?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (32:30);Well, I want to thank Isle of Wight Radio listeners for how much they’ve engaged with this idea today. And I can reassure you that there aren’t any changes to social distancing measures that are proposed as part of this pilot. The pilot is to find out how the app works, how the interaction of people then becomes recognized by the technology and the link from that to the human contact tracing, and to the testing regime, because there’s a new testing center on the Isle of Wight as well. So, there aren’t changes. Our proposals are that changes to the social distancing will only take place when the five tests are met. And that’s nationally rather than the Isle of Wight having any differences in that part to the rest of the country. Thanks very much indeed, Oliver. Joe Murphy from the Evening Standard."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Joe Murphy: (33:38);Good afternoon. Can I ask the scientists, how has your understanding of immunity developed over the last month or so? Do you know yet whether people will catch it again? And how are the tests developing? How are the testing of the tests going? Do you see antibodies and immunity playing a really significant role in easing out of lockdown or not? And, Secretary of State, if I could just ask a follow to Conrad’s question, who asked how low the numbers would go. You said very low. Can you put a figure on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (34:14);The answer to the second question is, no. And the answer to the first question is, I’ll say a little and then I’ll ask both scientists to come in, John on the testing and JVT on the science of immunity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (34:31);What I’d say is that antibody testing is incredibly important. We have antibody tests in the field at the moment. They’re being used for surveys. They are lab based, rather than the automatic response tests that we looked into in great detail a month or so ago. But then, none of them were effective enough to be used for clinical reasons. But they can still be used for surveys. So, we have surveys in the field, both with the stick tests and also with lab based serology which detects antibodies. So, we will be getting estimates soon of the proportion of the population who have the antibodies. The test tests for whether the antibodies are there. The effect of the antibodies on your risk to catching or transmitting Coronavirus in the future is the next important step in that. And the science on that has been rapidly developing. And I’ll ask JVT to update on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:38);Yes. Thank you for the question. So, on antibodies, one of the things we want to know is, when you’ve had a COVID-19 infection, do you get antibodies? Do they protect you against further instances of the same illness? And how long are they going to protect you for? So, that’s kind of three questions really. So, let’s chop this up into three answers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:08);And the first answer is, the first thing we wanted to know was, once you’ve had confirmed COVID-19 infection, do you get antibodies? And one of the things that we’ve been interested in and want to do is call people back who’ve had COVID-19 for sure and who’ve recovered to ask them if they’ll begin to take part in a program we’re starting to get plasma containing antibodies and use it for treatment in the future in trials to understand if it’s going to work and save lives. And the good news on that is that program has started. And the overwhelming majority of people so far called back who’ve had definite COVID-19 infection have got antibodies in their bloodstream, which is a good news thing. So, those antibodies take different times in different people to develop. But, by and large, the signal is that people get antibodies."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:14);The next question is, do those antibodies protect you from further infections? And we just haven’t had this disease around on the planet in humans for long enough to know the answers to that with any surety. And that’s a piece of science that we will just have to follow a bit longer. I hope the answer is yes. But I think it’s one where we have to be much clearer before we can take that responsibility of giving you a very clear answer on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:47);And then, the final piece is, how long will the antibodies last? And we do know that for other normal Coronaviruses, if that’s the right word, the ones that are a couple of viruses that, together with many others, cause what we’d call the common cold, that those antibodies don’t persist necessarily for years, and years, and years. Now, it doesn’t follow that that’s going to be the case with COVID-19. We do not know at this point. We will have to simply follow people who’ve recovered and test them repeatedly until we have an understanding of how long antibodies last and how long they protect for."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (38:33);But there is an absolutely massive piece of work now underway, multiple studies, to look for antibodies in different populations in the U.K. and, indeed, to follow some people who’ve recovered for long periods of time into the future, at least a couple of years. And we will have much clearer signals over time. But I’m afraid it’s just one of those where we can’t make the science go any faster than how quickly our bodies go in terms of maintaining the antibodies. And, like everybody else in the world, we just have to be patient and cautious until we get those answers. But I do believe, in the long run, once we have those kinds of answers, potentially antibody testing will be a very important part of our future strategy."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (39:26);Thanks. In fact, I’m in one of those trials, because I was tested positive. And now, fairly regularly somebody comes and takes blood to test whether I have antibodies. And then, also to test whether I get it again, because we have surveys in the field right now to test if people with antibodies then catch the disease, which is an absolutely critical fact will then determine policy over what we say people with antibodies who’ve tested positive on an antibody test can do. Which is, at the moment, we don’t yet have the science to make those policy decisions, but it will be absolutely critical. John, did you have anything to add on the testing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (40:11);Just briefly on the testing, there’s been really very good progress on the antibody tests. There are at least two large, commercial organizations who have developed good lamp based antibody tests, which we’re currently evaluating. But also, people looking at ways of doing antibody tests close to the person, the patient. And there are a number of options there including a saliva test. And all of these options are looking quite promising and being evaluated. So, I think, in general, we can say, as we thought, that there would be antibody tests available when we needed them. And they will support also our contact tracing program and strategy later on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (40:47);Fantastic. Follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Joe Murphy: (40:49);If I may, Secretary of State, and thank you all three for very informative answers there. Secretary of State, life is full of risks. And this is all about balance of risks. You are somebody who has probably got antibodies. Would you feel happy going into a crowded room?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (41:04);Not yet. Not yet. I very much hope that the science shows that the people with antibodies who tested positive for having antibodies have a low risk of transmitting the disease and the low risk of catching it. Both are important because low risk of catching it to protect me, low risk of transmitting it to protect others. I very much hope that that’s where the science comes out. That is true of most Coronaviruses. But we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got the science. Because, until we know that’s the case, we can’t be sure of it. We can’t base a policy decision on it. And I can’t be comfortable doing what you mentioned in the question because that might simply trigger a rise in the number of infections if the science turns out to be wrong. And there are so many novel things about this Coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (42:03);There are so many things that are different to previous… There’s the six existing coronaviruses, that we do have to test this and not base our assumptions on how other coronaviruses behave, because we don’t want to take the risk of assuming this coronavirus behaves like other coronaviruses before saying and taking a policy decision that people with antibodies are lower risk. But if the science concludes that they are, then we’ll take decisions on that basis. And I would say, this point of John’s, that there’s been big advances in antibody testing, especially the lab-based antibody testing, is very important. Today, Roche, the Swiss global diagnostics company, made a very positive announcement about progress with their antibody test, and we’re in discussions with them about a very large scale rollout of antibody testing, as well as with some others who may be able to bring this forward. But there’s been false hope before in antibody testing, and so we’ll make announcements when we’re absolutely ready. Thanks very much, Joe. Paul Waugh from the Huffington Post."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Paul Waugh: (43:20);Health Secretary, as you’ve frequently said, the longterm solution to this pandemic is a fully scaled up vaccine for COVID-19."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (43:28);Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Paul Waugh: (43:28);But a vaccine relies on as many people as possible actually taking it up. Now you told HuffPost last year, and I quote, “There’s a very strong argument for having compulsory vaccinations for children for when they go to school, because otherwise they’re putting other children at risk.” Would that apply to a COVID vaccine, as well as to MMR and other vaccines? And what are the measures are you looking at to ensure as many adults and children take up the new vaccine when it’s available? And if I can, to Professor Van-Tam, can I ask you what you’ve made of the early academic research done in Harvard, Germany and even Cambridge, that suggests high levels of air pollution may be one of the most important contributors to the clustering of deaths from COVID-19? Is SAGE looking at that, or going to look at that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (44:11);Thanks, Paul. Two very good questions. On the vaccine, the first and most important thing is that we support the development of the vaccine. And you all have seen the Prime Minister’s excellent announcement today. And then, that we also do the work to ensure that people can get access to the vaccine, starting with those who are most vulnerable. And on the question of whether to make it compulsory, I think that the extent of the public’s reaction to following the lockdown, shows that we will be able to achieve very, very high levels of vaccination without taking that step. And so, our task is to ensure that it is, in the first instance, we support the science as much as possible, because we can’t assume there’ll be a vaccine. There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. And for any of the existing coronaviruses, and this is uncertain science. But whilst I don’t rule anything out, we’re proceeding on the basis that just such a huge proportion of the population are going to take this up, because of the obvious benefits to individuals, and their families, and their communities, and indeed, the whole nation, that there’ll be enormous demand for it, as and when the science is safe to proceed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Van-Tam: (45:35);Yes, thank you Secretary of State. So, just to stay on the vaccine question for a little longer, we are following the developments in vaccine research across the world, including in the UK. We remain very hopeful that there will be a breakthrough at some point in the future. I think what I can say to you is that it is more likely than not, that the first vaccines will be licensed in adults in the first instance, and therefore, what has to put some caveats around your question around children. And the other thing to say is that, so far, the epidemiological evidence is not showing us that there is a massive burden of disease or burden of mortality in children. It is actually completely at the other end of the scale. It is in the elderly. And so, from that perspective, again, that’s another caveat I’d add to your question about vaccinating children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Van-Tam: (46:42);On the second question about air pollution, and thank you for that, I think we already have very solid data that air pollution contributes to a whole range of mortality, particularly from respiratory illnesses, and respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular disease. I have heard it said, about air pollution and COVID-19. I have not personally studied those data and looked at that question in detail, but what you say is entirely plausible, in my view. Professor Newton may have some further observations on air pollution."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (47:24);Well, only your general point that we know that air pollution, because it’s so pervasive and affects so many people, has a huge burden. But like Jonathan, I haven’t looked at those papers, but I think there’s something that we-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (47:34);Right. I think we’ll get back to you, Paul. The scientists will get back to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Paul Waugh: (47:38);Yeah, just one brief followup, Secretary of State. Do you have a message for those anti-vaxxers here and abroad, when and if we do get a vaccine for COVID-19?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (47:49);I think there has been no greater demonstration in modern history that vaccines save lives, than the need for a vaccine to save lives and to get the world going again, following the outbreak of COVID-19, and we will only license a vaccine when it is both effective, and safe, and when the independent regulators… If and when the independent regulators license a vaccine in this country, they will do so knowing that it is safe, and everybody should follow that advice. Thanks very much. Finally, we’re going to go to Louise Hill from the Isle of Wight County press."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Louise Hill: (48:42);Thank you Mr. Secretary. As a local democracy reporter out on the Isle of Wight, I have seen a mixed reaction to the app, but a main concern that keeps occurring is whether you can assure island residents who are wary of using the app and this technology, that their data will be kept fully protected and private throughout this trial and going forward, and the government will be fully transparent with islanders about the way this app works."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (49:06);Yes, absolutely. This is an incredibly important question. I was very glad to hear from Oliver from Isle of Wight Radio, on his initial survey, there was a very high degree of support for the app and for downloading it, but the app has been designed with privacy and security front of mind. It’s been signed off by the National Cyber Security Center, who’ve been involved in its development, and I want to thank them and pay tribute to the work that they’ve done in ensuring that the privacy and cybersecurity is strong. The data is stored on in individual’s phone, not by the NHS, until somebody finds that they’ve got symptoms, and then they need a test, and so they need to connect to the NHS. And then, the NHS needs to contact those who you’ve been in contact with. And so, this has the highest level of privacy built in to make sure that we can both reassure people, in terms of privacy, but also, that it can be effective and save lives. I don’t know if you’ve got anything to add on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (50:20);Well, no. Exactly right, Secretary, but just to be absolutely clear, the app itself doesn’t hold any personal information. It just has information about the phone, where it was, which other phones it’s been in contact with, but only using anonymized randomly generated numbers. And those are the data that are collated. So, no personal information is contained by the app, or generated by the app. As the Secretary said, the only personal information used is when somebody approaches the NHS to have a test, or to have their contact traced. So, it’s a very safe use of data, and people should feel very reassured by all the precautions that have been taken."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (50:59);Thanks very much indeed. Thank you, from the Isle… Have you got a follow up? You’ve got it… Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Louise Hill: (51:04);Sorry. Yes, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (51:04);No, sure."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Louise Hill: (51:06);So, as you said earlier, we’re told the lockdown won’t be eased on the island as part of the rollout of this app. That means people are already either at home or making very limited trips. And as the app is predominantly aimed at the islands key workers, will that guarantee enough useful data for the app, going forward?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (51:26);This is a really important question that we thought about when selecting where to try it. Because there’s a busy hospital on the island, and there’s other key workers, including those who work for the counsel, for instance, and in the other services right across the board, there are interactions, and there are new cases on the island, and so we think that it will be effective, and it will be an effective place to pilot. But also, we think that the Test, Track and Trace system, as a whole, will be more effective when there are fewer new cases, because then, when you do find a new case, we can really support that person, find out who they’ve been in contact with, and then contact all of those people, and we can put quite a lot of effort and support into then, trying to stop that case from spreading any further."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (52:29);So actually, the Test, Track and Trace system, as a whole, will be more effective when there’s fewer cases, and currently, there are fewer cases on the island than there are in the rest of the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (52:41);Thank you very much indeed. Thanks for all the questions from the public, from the national media, from the Isle of Wight. And I’m very grateful for this opportunity to have sat out these details of our Test, Track and Trace program, and look forward to seeing you again, from here in Downing street very soon. Thanks very much."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (00:05);Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m joined by Professor Angela McLean, chief scientific advisor at the MOD. First, let me give an update on the latest data that we have on coronavirus. And I can report that through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program that as of today, there have now been 1,383,842 tests for coronavirus across the UK, including 84,806 tests yesterday. We know that 194,990 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 4,406 cases since yesterday. And of those who have tested positive, 29,427 have very sadly died, and our hearts go out to everyone who has lost a loved one throughout the coronavirus challenge."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (01:01);We continue to see evidence of a flattening of the peak of this virus. But as the figures that I’ve just read out show, it’s not over yet. So in the coming days, Sage will update ministers with their latest scientific advice. And as ever, we will make sure that we continue to be guided by their advice as we take the decisions on next steps in fighting this virus. Alongside the advice that we get from Sage, our five tests remain absolutely key."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (01:34);First, we must continue to boost NHS capacity so that the NHS cannot be overwhelmed. Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths. Thirdly, we must see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels across all different settings and areas. Fourth, we must be confident that the NHS will be able to cope with future demands, including as a result of any changes that we make to existing measures or, indeed, any new measures that we might wish to take. And fifth and above all, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures won’t risk a second peak of infections that could then overwhelm the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (02:18);Later on this week, the PM will update the country on the measures and the decisions that we will need to take to protect the NHS, to safeguard the economy, and to avoid the risk of a second peak that will be damaging both for public health but also for jobs and the wider economy. And as we consider the decisions that we will take next to protect life but also to protect our way of life, it’s now clear that the second phase will be different. We will need to adjust to a new normal where we as a society adapt to safe, new ways to work, to travel, to interact, and to go about our daily lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (02:57);We’ve never experienced anything like this first stage of COVID-19 in terms of the scale of the lives lost but also the lockdown that it has required. And as we go forward, we want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable, and prevents lasting damage to jobs and livelihoods. But we need to be under no illusions. The next stage won’t be easy. And if we’re going to protect life and preserve our way of life, as I just said, we must continue to be guided by the scientific advice we receive and make sure the next steps that we take are sure-footed and sustainable."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (03:39);Now before I hand over to Angela to run through the data slides, I want to provide an update on one further feature that coronavirus, as a challenge, has thrown up for this country and, indeed, for the whole world. Whilst the vast majority of people and countries have come together and rallied to this international mission to defeat coronavirus, there will always be some who seek to exploit a crisis for their own criminal and hostile ends."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (04:10);We know that cyber criminals and other malicious groups are targeting individuals, businesses, and other organizations by deploying COVID-19-related scams and phishing emails, and that includes groups that, in the cybersecurity world, are known as advanced persistent threat groups, sophisticated networks of hackers who try to breach computer systems. And we have clear evidence now that these criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organizations, which are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which I have to say makes them particularly dangerous and venal at this time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (04:49);So we’re working with the targets of those attacks, with the potential targets, and with others to make sure that they’re aware of the cyber threat and that they can take the steps necessary to protect themselves or, at the very least, mitigate the harm that could be wrought against them. So with that in mind, today the UK’s National Cybersecurity Center and the US Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency have published a joint warning about these groups. And we’ve offered some advice on the cyber criminals and other actors who are seeking to exploit COVID-19 through malicious cyber activity. Our teams have identified campaigns targeting health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and also various different arms of local government. Now there are various objectives and motivations that lie behind these attacks, from fraud, on the one hand, to espionage. But they tend to be designed to steal bulk personal data, intellectual property, and wider information that supports those aims. And they’re often linked with other state actors. And we expect this kind of predatory criminal behavior to continue and to evolve over the coming weeks and months ahead, and we’re taking a range of measures to tackle that threat. So as we’ve done today, we’ll share advice on the nature of those threats to enable businesses, citizens, and our international partners to better defend themselves against the full range of cyber attack from hostile states to criminal gangs."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (06:27);Preventative action is often the very best way to deny attackers the opportunities that they’re looking for. The National Cyber Security Center offers a range of practical advice to safeguard against cyber attacks, from things like the use of online passwords to guidance on what are the trusted sources of online information related to COVID-19, like the gov.uk site or Public Health England."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (06:54);Now as well as providing practical advice, the UK will continue to counter those who conduct cyber attacks. And we’re working very closely with our international partners to respond to the threats but also to deter the gangs and the arms of state who lie behind them. We’re absolutely determined to defeat coronavirus and also to defeat those trying to exploit the situation for their own nefarious ends. And with that, I’ll pass over to Professor McLean to give us the latest update on the data."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (07:27);Thank you. If I could have the first slide, please. So the first slide reminds us, what are the five tests for adjusting lockdown? And number one is that we should always ensure that the NHS has enough capacity, that it’s able to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The second is that we should see a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from coronavirus. And the third is that there must be reliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. Fourth is that operational challenges, including testing and PPE, must be in-hand with supply able to meet future demand. And fifth is that we should be confident that any adjustments that are made to current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (08:29);If I could have the next slide, please. So this is a slide about transport use and how it’s changed in Great Britain since the … Let’s have a look. Since February. So those percentages are relative to normal use during February. And the vertical dotted line is the date when lockdown started. And what you see is that for public transport, there has been a very marked and very persistent fall, and that’s for bus, for tube, for national rail, and also, in gray further back, for buses in London."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (09:08);For motor vehicles, so that’s the top, dark blue line, what you see is a pattern that looks a bit like commuting because it’s low every weekend, and we do worry about that creeping up. I think all of us remember that what we’ve done together, which is to stay home, has worked to protect the NHS and save lives. And as one of the people who looks at this data and thinks about how it fits into how we think about the future, it does trouble me that the dark blue line is creeping up again. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (09:43);This is the number of tests that have occurred every day in the UK since 6th of April up until the most recent data, which are from yesterday. And what you see is that very dramatic rise that happened during April, so that now we do have a lot of tests available that allow us to design the kinds of testing strategies that we’re going to need in the future. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (10:09);This is one of the ways we have of counting how many people in the UK are infected. So in two colors here are people who have tested positive. In dark blue are people who are tested by the NHS, and in orange are people whose tests were performed by universities, research institutes, and private companies. So most of the people in the dark blue pillars there are either patients or NHS staff, whereas most of the people in the orange pillars are other key workers. And this data is extremely interesting, but it is quite susceptible to the fact that the number of tests has been increasing, and who’s allowed to have a test has also been changing. So actually, I find the next slide a lot more informative. So what this is is the number of new inpatients-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (11:03);… in hospitals in England every day with COVID. So this is every day since the 20th of March. Either in dark blue, an inpatient who was in hospital and got back a COVID positive test, or in gold there somebody who arrived at hospital having already tested positive. So this is always the same kind of people and these people were always the top priority to get a test. So in some sense this is a much more pure data stream from the one I showed you before. And in fact to my mind at least makes much more sense. So what you see is that number rising from the 20th of March until it peaks on the 2nd of April. Now 2nd of April is about the date we would have expected it to peak. Because that’s about 10 days after the 23rd of March when lockdown came in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (11:58);And then from the 2nd of April it falls away pretty rapidly. So what this is, is the inflow into the hospital system of people who are COVID positive. And we watch this number with great care every day. If I could have the next slide. So that was the inflow into the hospital system. This is the total number of people in hospital with COVID on any given day. So that’s the really the balance between people who came in and people who left. And so that has a rather smoother pattern and a much slower fall. And what you see is that that peaked around about the 10th or so of April in London. That the peak in London was much higher than everywhere else. Perhaps very slightly earlier. And the fall in the number of people in hospital in London has been faster than everywhere else. So much so now actually, but in the last couple of days the number of people in London, sorry, in hospital in London now exceeds numbers in hospital in the Northwest."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (13:08);Next slide please. This keeps track of the proportion of critical care beds that are occupied by patients with COVID-19. And what you see is that that also has fallen from its peak in early April, now down to less than a third of all the critical care beds being occupied by COVID-19 patients. It’s been decreasing for most of the UK over the last two weeks, and it’s beginning to come down to what we might define as more manageable levels. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (13:50);These are recorded deaths from COVID-19. In blue bars are the actual numbers reported each day. So today being the 5th of May, we got Monday’s figures in. And you can see there’s a very regular pattern that numbers at the weekend are always lower than the days subsequently. So that jump from the 4th of May to the 5th of May is something that we would expect. Because this data has such a strong pattern across different days of the week, it makes sense to look at a seven day rolling average, and that’s what the orange line is. And what you can see from that orange line is that the number of COVID recorded deaths is falling and has been falling steadily since the middle of April. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (14:43);This records registered deaths from COVID-19 by the place where that death occurred. And that we’ve got it for five different weeks. And the most recent week for which we have this data is the week of the 24th of April. The gray bars are deaths in hospital, the dark gray bars are deaths in care homes, pale blue is deaths in one’s own home, and dark blue is other places. And what you see is that whilst deaths in hospital have been falling, deaths in care homes in the week to the 24th of April worst arising, to the extent that in that week deaths in care homes we’re about half as many as all the deaths in hospitals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (15:33);I think what that shows us is that there is a real issue that we need to get to grips with about what is happening in care homes. The final slide for today is a comparison of numbers of deaths for different countries. The UK which is COVID deaths in all settings is the gray line in the middle there. And what you see is that deaths in the UK is still continuing to climb and is higher than we would wish. I think is all I can say. And with that I’ll [inaudible 00:16:08] end the data slides for today."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (16:12);Angela, thank you very much. We’ll now take some questions starting with questions from members of the public. Do we have Brandon from Gloucestershire?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Brendan: (16:21);My name is Brandon McInerney and I volunteer in the local community in Gloucester, Gloucestershire. My question is, as we come through the tough times of COVID, how can we embed our reflective learning so as to ensure we address inequalities across community and neighborhoods, and continue to invest and empower local communities to thrive. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (16:56);Well Brandon thank you very much. And I want to pay tribute to everyone in Gloucestershire from the key workers like the NHS staff to people working in care homes to all those doing those critical jobs whether it’s in supermarkets or running deliveries, which have kept the lifeblood of our communities going. I think you’re absolutely right to say that particularly after a pretty unique pandemic, something that certainly I’ve never seen before in my lifetime, we will all want to learn lessons in this country and across the world. And I think one of the things that we found with coronavirus is that it hasn’t discriminated. We’ve got the Prime Minister who’s been laid low with it. We’ve got people all across the country. No one has been impervious to this virus. And I think it’s also taught us to appreciate those key workers that I mentioned. Not just those in the NHS and care homes who are obviously doing an amazing job. But also those keeping our supermarkets running, keeping deliveries flowing and up and down the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (17:57);And as you will probably remember from the general election, the Prime Minister’s big overarching goal is to level up right across the country. And I think this crisis has been a timely reminder how important that agenda and that political agenda is going to be. But first things first, we’ve got to get through this crisis, recover bounce back if we can the economy, make sure those small businesses and the employees are [inaudible 00:18:24] and we provide them with a bridge through the current set of challenges. And make sure I think we come together as one country is, I think we’ve seen in this national mission to tackle the current virus and try and keep that spirit alive and as we go forward. But I think there are lessons to be learned and there are opportunities to learn those lessons in a really positive way when we come through the immediate crisis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (18:44);May I."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (18:47);Angela please if you’ve got."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (18:48);I think you raised an incredibly important point Bran. Infectious diseases always do and always will target the disadvantaged. And I think one of the things that we fear as we hopefully bring the incidents of infections of the number of people who are infected every day, right down to very low levels is that, infection will disappear into parts of our communities that are really, really hard to reach. And I think it’s incumbent on all of us including our scientists to find ways that we could make sure that we can track the ongoing spread of infection amongst every part of our society."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (19:27);Yeah, thanks Angela. I think next up is Jane from West Yorkshire. I think we’ve got, Jane from West Yorkshire asks, I’ll read this out because we’ve had this one messaged in to us, “In respect of the track and tracer, is this something that will work worldwide once travel can begin again and if not, why was this not embarked upon as a global initiative?” I think the reality is we want the app to be focused on the UK and we want the technology to be tailored to make sure we can deal with the specific challenges that we’ve got in this country. We’ve worked with the experts, we’ve gotten the National Cyber Security Center to make sure we’ve got the greatest protections on things like privacy."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (20:09);And we’ve got very high standards, both of professionalism both of privacy as we embark on what will be an unprecedented IT project. And not everyone and not all countries around the world will have the same standards. Whether their tech standards or whether their privacy standards. So I think it’s right to say we should learn internationally about the tech innovation that’s going on. But we want to make sure we’ve got something tailored to UK needs and we’re applying very highest UK standards. Angela, I don’t think this is any [crosstalk 00:20:37]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (20:38);[crosstalk 00:20:38] I think [inaudible 00:20:38]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (20:40);All right. Thank you Jane for that question. We’ll go on to ask David Shipman from the BBC onto the media. David."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","David: (20:48);Thank you very much indeed. Yes a question about the death tolls. Looking at the official figures that you’ve just announced and comparing them with figures announced this evening by Italy, it does not seem that the UK has had more deaths from COVID-19 than any other country in Europe. If it does turn out that we are the country that’s hardest hit in Europe, what’s your reaction to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (21:13);Well, thanks David. You’re asking me to speculate there. All I’d just say is first of all, 29,427 are lives lost is a massive tragedy. Something in this country on this scale, in this way that we’ve never seen before. And as I said before my heart goes out to anyone that’s lost a loved one. And in terms of the comparison that you’re suggesting, as the scientist have all said, I can remember Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty talking about this. I don’t think we’ll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over. And in particularly, until we’ve got comprehensive international data on all cause mortality. But I think there’s two points that I’d make about the way the UK has approached things. There are different ways of counting deaths as we know. We’ve had that debate in this country. We now publish data that includes…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (22:03);…debate in this country. We now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that so I’m not sure that the international comparison works unless you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way. And it also depends on how good, frankly, countries are in gathering their statistics. And our own Office of National Statistics is widely acknowledged to be a world leader. And one of the reasons we’ve embraced that is cause we want transparency because we are confident and we believe that it’s only if we get the full transparency that we’ll be in the best place to tackle this virus. So I think it is important, but I don’t think you can make the international comparisons you’re suggesting at this stage. Not, at least I doubt you can make them reliably. Angela."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (22:43);I would just reiterate, I think we have decided that our measure of how things have gone will be age adjusted all cause mortality because that will capture all kinds of impacts of COBID, not just the COVID deaths. And clearly it’ll be important to do what we can to make international comparisons. Everybody knows that making international comparisons in such statistics can be difficult and it may be that that will take some time to sort out, and this isn’t over yet."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (23:17);Dave, do you want to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dave: (23:20);On another topic if I may."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (23:22);Of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dave: (23:22);Last week, the prime minister suggested there may be situations where there could be benefits from the public wearing masks. Does that mean that UK government policy on this has changed, and if it hasn’t changed, might the public be forgiven for being a bit confused?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (23:38);Well, of course you’re always trying to tempt us to get as one or two steps ahead of the game. The reality is, we’re considering the sage advice. That advice has been nuanced, if I can set like that. The evidence is rather finely balanced, but we’ll make sure that we consider it very carefully. One of the things we don’t want to do is give people inaccurate advice or create false confidence or comfort in masks. And also, there’s a key difference between masks, for example, the self-made masks that some people around the world have been encouraged to use and the clinical masks that we need for the NHS. And we do not want to detract from the supplies of masks and other PPE, frankly, going to the frontline and the NHS or care home workers, but the wider advice we’ll consider and shortly be saying more on. Angela, is there anything you’d add?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (24:26);Nothing to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (24:28);Thanks David. Robert Peston at ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Robert: (24:33);Good afternoon. I absolutely accept that it’s too early to draw firm conclusions about whether our death rate will be the highest in Europe. But Angela, you just said when pointing to your own chart of international comparisons, the death toll is higher than we would wish. On the basis of that, we have recently instituted a new system of mask testing and we’re recruiting lots of people to do tracking, tracing and quarantining. Would you hope, when this new infrastructure is in place, that that death line will track down to nearer Germany and Korea, which have much lower death rates? Because after all, as Chris Whitty said on Friday, we’re going to be living with coronavirus possibly forever and the lethality of coronavirus is going to take us months, if not years to get it down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (25:32);Well, Rob, let me, let me have a first stab and then I’ll hand over to Angela. I mean, the first thing to say is that the big thing that has helped us flatten the peak is the public’s adherence to the social distancing guidance that we’ve laid out. Not only has that helped reduce the number of deaths there would otherwise have been, they could have been higher, but it’s also helped us preserve NHS capacity, which means that we’ve been able to deal with COVID-19 patients, but also other patients. I think the key is going to be with tests, tracking and tracing is going to be the extent to which it gives us the flexibility to transition into a second phase safely in a sure-footed way and sustainably. And I think that’s the key to the tests, tracking and tracing. Angela."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (26:17);So that last graph that I was showing you is actually cumulative deaths, so there is no way it can go down. The very best that it can do is go flat, because once there are no deaths, it becomes completely flat. And of course, I want it to become flat for the UK as quickly as possible. And the only way other countries could catch up would be if they had more deaths. And I’m certainly not going to wish that on anybody. So I think the sooner all of these can settle down to flat lines, the better."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (26:52);Rob, do you want to come back with any more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Robert: (26:54);Yep. But just on that, just do you think mass testing, tracking, tracing is going to be the big initiative that gets that curve to flatten in the way that we all want?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (27:08);Yeah. I mean, I think we’re all of us working really hard to figure out if we can do contact tracing in a way that will really start to find all of the infections out there in the community, find people who have symptoms, get them tested, find good, quick, reliable ways to find the people they’ve been in contact with, and ask them to go into quarantine. That is the strategy that has worked in South Korea, and South Korea is really the place in the world that we can look to and say this worked. It’s a large country like we are. They did have quite a big outbreak actually that they brought under control with contact tracing. So I think they are a fine example to us and we should try to emulate what they’ve achieved."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (27:55);And Rob, just I think we need to be really clear about the moment we’re at, and the relevance and the value of test tracking and tracing. Our real risk right now as we come through the peak, we start to see us come through the worst stage of this crisis, is that we move to ease up too early without having a sensible sure footage plan, and we see a second spike or a second wave. Test, tracking and tracing allows us, as well as getting the R rate down through the social distancing measures, which gives us extra flexibility, test, tracking and tracing allows us to manage that very carefully because any second reemergence of the virus, wherever it may be, we can control and measure and monitor very swiftly. I think that’s the crucial importance of it. Sam Coates from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Sam Coates: (28:41);Andrew McLean, the Scottish government today released scientific research suggesting that if schools go back north of the border, then hospitals could be overwhelmed there within two months, and in the worst case scenario become more than seven times oversubscribed. Is that based on science that you recognize, and what might be the policy lessons that you could draw from that? And First Secretary of State, Boris Johnson has said that there will be some delays at the border when we leave the current Brexit implementation period. Today we also began treat talks with the US. Given the level of uncertainty facing the economy and business, is this additional burden the right thing to do at this time, or conversely, do you think that are actually benefits from doing Brexit tools at this time?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (29:24);Well, look, I think there is a whole load of uncertainty. I’ve worked very closely with my European opposite numbers right across Europe, and actually it’s been a good example of frankly, in this challenge, we come together, we work on practical cooperation, whether it’s PPE, procurement or returning our nationals, and we have very close cooperation. It reminds us of the ties that do bind us together. I think on all sides, we want to avoid any further uncertainty. So actually, the smart thing for us to do is focus on the track that we’ve got. Are we making good progress? Are we making progress, I should say, in relation to the future relationship negotiations. We’re not there yet, but the right thing to do, I think for the UK but also for the EU, is to avoid any future uncertainty beyond the end of this year by agreeing, which ought to be a reasonably straightforward approach, negotiating the detail will never be entirely straightforward, but because it’s based on the standard precedents that the EU has adopted with other third countries, and that will be the surest way to make sure we can give our economies that boost by maintaining seamless and as frictionless trade as possible. And that is the way both the UK and European countries got an opportunity to bounce back after this. I think prolonging the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiation is unnecessary and will actually make that uncertainty worse. Angela, on the one for you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (30:51);So I don’t know the study that you’re talking about, but I do know that we there are some profound uncertainties in the underlying data about how likely children are to catch COVID, and how infectious they would be if they caught it. And it’s really quite difficult to trace because they tend to not have symptoms really, or their symptoms are very mild if they do catch it. So there’s not very much data because there haven’t been many children with symptoms. And of course most schools have been in lockdown for a long time now. So it’s perfectly possible to produce projections for what’s going to happen based on reasonable interpretations of rather a thin evidence base that go either way. That being said, one of the things that everybody is very clear about is that whatever we change, we will make absolutely sure that we were monitoring the situation so that we don’t get explosive outbreaks whether they started in schools or in workplaces."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (31:51);So I don’t imagine any country in the UK having an outbreak that would overwhelm the health systems sevenfold. One of the things we can do, as well as making the absolute, most of all the data that we do have, is to watch very carefully in those countries that have reopened their schools and see what happens there. So that’s one of the several things we are doing in order to make a decision based on as much science as we can find about what is likely to happen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (32:29);Sam, would you like to come back on any of those points?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Sam Coates: (32:33);It was just in the answer to my question for Secretary of State, you corrected yourself from good progress to just progress. Why is the end of year deadline quite so important given the massive scale of the pandemic crisis that we’re facing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (32:46);Well, I know that if we talk about the positives of this, there’ll be someone somewhere on either side of the channel who will say, “Oh, well, no, it’s going terribly.” The reality is progress is being made and we’re confident we can get there. Look, we do face a challenge with coronavirus. There’ll be damage to the economy. We want to bounce back, but-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (33:03);… actually one of the things we know that businesses would like some certainty of knowing that this has been concluded. I think the country wants some certainty. We were elected on that basis, and actually what this crisis ought to allow us to do, not least through the goodwill and the spirit of cooperation that we’ve had with our European partners, is to knuckle down, focus on what really matters, agree a pretty well precedented free trade agreement with our EU partners, which they’ve already agreed with other third countries, and allow both sides to move on in that spirit of cooperation and goodwill that I mentioned. So that’s what we’ll be focused on. Sam thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (33:41);Jason Groves from the Daily Mail. Jason."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Jason Groves: (33:45);Thanks. Foreign Secretary, can I pick up on Sam’s question though about schools and ask what you think the prospects of them reopening are, given the profound uncertainties that Professor McLean talks about, and the fact that Scotland seems to be pretty clear they’re not going to be opening their schools anytime soon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Jason Groves: (34:06);And Professor McLean, can I ask you about one of the emerging risk factors, that of obesity? There seems to be a lot of interest in this subject. I wonder, could you tell us anything about how much evidence there is that it’s a risk factor, and whether people should think about going on a diet?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (34:25);Jason, thanks very much. So on the issue of schools, first of all, I really feel for parents who’ve had the challenge of balancing a working from home with homeschooling. I feel for the teachers who have had to make that work as well. I think there’s been an exceptional effort to make that viable, and to make it work. It’s also schools being closed has an impact on the economy, because so many of those workers can’t go back to work as normal."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (34:52);The crucial bit for us is the five tests, and the risk of a second spike in relation to any new changes that we would make. But that must of course include schools. So one of the things we’ve done is we’ve asked Sage to look at different options. I don’t think it’s binary. And I think the one thing I can say with confidence is at least to date, the evidence has been that we wouldn’t be able to open up all schools without a very real risk that the R-rate, so the transmission rate, would rise at such a level that we would risk a second spike. But we’ve asked Sage for the options on this. And we’ll, as ever be, continued to be guided by the scientific advice we get."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (35:32);And you wanted me to talk about obesity? So we have very fine evidence actually from rather beautiful studies gathered from inpatients in our hospitals with COVID-19. And those studies show that indeed, once you’re in hospital, being obese is an additional risk factor for being admitted to an ICU, or indeed for death."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (35:53);My understanding about the way to lose weight is that going on a diet isn’t the way to do it, and what you have to do is actually decide to completely change your lifestyle. You have to decide to do something that’s going to be enduring, not just going on a diet. And I understand that that’s a really difficult thing to do, but under all circumstances, pandemic or no pandemic, it’s better not to be obese."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (36:18);Thanks Jason. Can we go on to Andy Diamond from The Mirror please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Andy Diamond: (36:24);Yes. Foreign Secretary, in France and Holland professional sports has been suspended until September at the earliest, but here the Premier League is making extremely detailed plans for a possible return in mid-June. Is this realistic? And is the government actively encouraging it as a measure that might somehow lift the spirits of the nation?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (36:49);Well Andy, I think it would lift the spirits of the nation. I think people would like to see as get back, not just to work and get to a stage where safely our children go to school, but also enjoy some of those pastimes, sporting in particular. I know the government’s had constructive meetings with sports bodies to plan for athletes to resume training when it’s safe to do so. I can tell you that the culture secretary has also been working on a plan to get sports played behind closed doors, when we move to the second phase, so that’s something that I can tell you we’re looking at."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (37:25);Of course we come back to the key point though, we can only do it when the medical and the scientific advice is that it can be done safely and sustainably. But certainly that’s something under active consideration. Andy anything else you’d like to ask?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Andy Diamond: (37:40);Yes. When you say, “Safely,” will there always be an element of risk if Premier League footballers, or any footballers, any sportsman go back to playing? And secondly if we are, as you’ve now said, professional sports will be behind closed doors, will that be the case until a vaccine is found? Whether that be 12 months, 18 months, two years? Are we looking at professional sports behind closed doors until that moment?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (38:10);Thanks. I can’t look too far into the future because there are various different ways we could get control of the virus permanently, defeat it for good, a vaccine is certainly one of those. Therapeutics are another."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (38:23);I think we’re all waiting to see how effective internationally test tracking and tracing can be, but I think that’s also an option. But whether it’s a combination of tests, tracking, tracing, and other social distancing measures within what’s possible within a sporting environment, we want to see whether behind closed doors what the options are for doing that. So I think it’s worth taking a close look at that, seeing whether it’s possible to do it safely, but as ever taken the scientific and the medical advice as to when and how to proceed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (38:53);Andy, thank you very much. I think finally we’ve got Will Hayward from the Western Mail and WalesOnline, Will."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Will Hayward: (39:01);Thank you. My first question is for the Foreign Secretary. Watching these press conferences for the past six weeks has been very confusing for many people in Wales, as some of the language you use makes it very unclear if what is said applies to them because of devolution. Clearly Foreign Affairs, such as repatriating people from abroad does apply, however commonly mentioned issues around schools, local government, support for vulnerable people, healthcare, and even the rules of lockdown itself do not actually apply to people in Wales. Do you concede that the government could have been clearer up till now, and will you and your ministerial colleagues commit to making the distinction as to what issues apply just to England in the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (39:39);Well Will, all I’d say in the PM’s absence, I’ve chair two of the Cobras I’ve been in a number of others. We’ve had, I’ve got to say good cooperation with all the developed ministrations, including with the first minister in Wales."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (39:52);If you look in practice at the social distancing measures, and I’ve talked a bit earlier in this press conference about the level of compliance, it has been remarkably consistent across all of the nation. So we’ve actually been pretty much in lockstep all the way. I think the right thing to do is to try and proceed on a consistent basis, respecting the constitutional settlement of course, and that’s what we’ve done so far. And that’s one of the reasons we’ve been so effective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (40:18);So I think we can pull together and as one United Kingdom see ourselves sustainably through this crisis. Angela, is there anything you’d add to that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (40:33);There’s not much I would add. I think we’ve succeeded so far together, and that that would seem a sensible way to go forward."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (40:35);Great. Did you want to come back on any of that Will?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Will Hayward: (40:39);Sorry. The point I was making was as much about the language in these press conferences for people in Wales, and who naturally might not be that well versed in every bit of minutia around devolution."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Will Hayward: (40:51);My second question is actually follows on from that. The first minister of Wales has stated his desire for Wales and England to come out of lockdown together in order to keep the message simple. How is Wales able to input into the announcements about lockdown, that we are expecting this weekend and next week? And just to Professor McLean if I may, does Sage take into account Welsh data and the impact on Wales when offering advice to NHS England? And has there been any marked differences between Wales and England?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (41:19);So just in terms of the formal structures, it’s really important that we do try and make sure that there’s early and consistent and continued cooperation and consultation. So we do that through the Welsh office, with Michael Gove in the cabinet office doing it. And of course we have those Cobra meetings that I discussed which bring all four nations of the United Kingdom together. And actually, we’re flexible, we’re pragmatic, we’re not insisting on form over substance. But actually if you look at the substance, and I come back to the record, the consistent record of compliance with the social distancing measures, we’ve done a pretty good job of working together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (41:54);So I think the key is that there’s the political will on all sides to continue that. And I hope, and I’m confident that there will be. Angela?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Angela McLean: (42:01);So on the science, we worked very hard to include all four nations. Sometimes there are data streams that we only have for England at the moment, but we do try to make it clear to our colleagues why we think they are incredibly useful, and therefore why it would be fantastic if we could also have them from other countries. So both on [Spym 00:42:18] and also in Sage, yes we certainly do think about Wales, I promise you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-5","Dominic Raab: (42:22);Will, thanks very much. That brings this press conference to a close. Thank you all very much."
