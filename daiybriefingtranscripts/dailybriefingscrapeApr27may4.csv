"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (00:00);Today’s briefing will follow a bit of a new format following significant demand as well as questions from the media. We’ll take our first question from a member of the public. This is going to become a regular feature of these briefings. The questions are selected by an independent polling organization and just like the journalist questions, we don’t see the questions in advance, but we’ll give them the very best answers that we can. In the past few hours, since we announced this new approach, we’ve had over 15,000 questions submitted and you can ask a question yourself by going to gov.uk\ask. And today I’m joined by Professor Chris Whitty and Professor Steve Powis, the medical director of the NHS. The government is working through our action plan and at its core the objective is to protect life and to protect the NHS both by slowing the spread of the virus so that we flatten the curve and by ensuring that the NHS always has more than enough capacity to provide critical care for all those who need it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (01:18);According to the most recent figures, there have been 719,910 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 37,024 yesterday. 157,149 people have tested positive. That’s an increase of 4,310 cases since yesterday. 15,051 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 15,239 yesterday and sadly of those hospitalized with the virus, 21,092 have now died. That’s an increase of 360 fatalities. And we must never lose sight of the human cost of coronavirus and the pain and the grief that it causes. And each death serves as a reminder that we must stand firm in our resolve. Sadly, these deaths figures include 82 NHS colleagues and 16 colleagues who work in social care. They dedicated their lives to caring for others and I feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones. Today, I’m able to announce that the government is setting up a life assurance scheme for NHS and social care frontline colleagues."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (02:54);Families of staff who die from coronavirus in the course of their essential frontline work will receive a 60,000 pound payment. Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one, but we want to do everything that we can to support families who are dealing with this grief. And as a government, we’re looking closely at other professions that work on the frontline against coronavirus who also do not have access to such schemes to see where this may be required. This gross crisis has shown this country values so much our health and social care workers and I want to pay tribute to the perseverance of the British public who, even this warm spring weekend, in the vast majority did the right thing and stayed at home to protect the NHS. Thus far in this crisis at every single hour of every single day the NHS has always had the capacity to treat the people who need that treatment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (04:09);I’m glad to be able to report that there are now 3,190 spare critical care beds. Indeed, 42% of oxygen supported beds in the NHS now lie empty. And in most parts of the country, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is beginning to fall. One of the reasons NHS capacity has always exceeded need is because of our amazing program of NHS Nightingale Hospitals. Today, I was proud to attend virtually the opening of the eighth of our 10 Nightingale Hospitals across the UK. Again, built in a matter of weeks. This Nightingale Hospital Project stands as a monument to the nation’s ability to get things done when it matters. This is one of the most ambitious projects this country has ever seen in peace time and I’d like to thank the NHS, the armed forces, and all the companies that have worked side by side to make these plans of reality."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (05:12);The Nightingale Project is just one of the measures that’s boosted capacity all across the NHS. By reenlisting thousands of former staff, former clinicians, and enrolling early thousands of students. We’ve boosted the workforce of the NHS and we’ve changed forever the digital capability of the NHS. I think many people who’ve now used online GP consultations and online outpatient visits won’t ever go back. And I pay tribute to the staff who’ve worked in different ways to how they would ever have imagined and who’ve been more flexible and open to change when it was really needed. So where there have been advances amongst these huge challenges of this crisis, we must not lose them. However, we also know that fewer people are coming to the NHS when they need to and the attendances have dropped to 221,000 emergency department attendances in the last week compared to 477,000 in the same week last year."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (06:20);That’s more than 50%. Now some of this drop is due to lower road traffic and people following the social distancing rules. Some of it will be due to people accessing the NHS in ways that work better for them, like online or through pharmacies. And that’s a good thing. But in some cases we know that the drop is due to people not coming forward and using the NHS for critical things that matter. Our message is that the NHS is open. Help us to help you. So if you’re worried about chest pains, for instance, maybe you might be having a heart attack or a stroke, or you feel a lump and you’re worried about cancer or you’re a parent concerned about your child, please come forward and seek help as you always would. It is so important that everybody uses the NHS responsibly and the NHS will always be there for you when you need it just as it’s been there for us all throughout this crisis and throughout our lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (07:27);And as the number of hospitalizations from coronavirus begins to fall, I can announce that starting tomorrow we’ll begin the restoration of other NHS services starting with the most urgent, like cancer care and mental health support. The exact pace of the restoration will be determined by local circumstances on the ground according to local need and according to the amount of a coronavirus cases that that hospital is having to deal with. Having written off 13.4 billion pounds worth of historic NHS debt, I want to ensure that the NHS is always there in a way that doesn’t just help us recover from coronavirus as a country, but also puts us in a stronger position for the future. We’re coming through this peak. We’ll honor those who’ve dedicated their lives to caring for others, but it will count for nothing if we let things slip now and risk a second peak. I know that lockdown is hard for so many people, but let us all have the resolve to see this through. So please stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives. We’re now going to go to Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for the daily data charts, and then we’re going to take questions from the public."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Professor Chris Whitty: (08:56);Thank you very much, Secretary of State. So just the first slide is just a reminder to people of the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. The first three of which are about the epidemic that the NHS has capacity to provide critical care across the UK, a sustained and consistent fall in the daily deaths overall from coronavirus, and the rate of infection decreased to manageable levels across the board. Then there’s an operational point about operational challenges including testing and PPE in hand with supply, able to meet future demand, and then finally and importantly confident that the adjustments to current measures will not risk a second peak of infections. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Professor Chris Whitty: (09:44);The next two slides are really ways of looking at whether people are continuing as they have been consistently throughout this crisis to heed the guidance in terms of keeping pressure off the NHS by staying at home unless they have to go out for necessary things. And as you can see, after a very remarkable fall, initially, broadly, this has been flat, very slight trending up in terms of motor vehicles, but otherwise really the data remain largely unchanged on these transport metrics."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Professor Chris Whitty: (10:18);Next slide please. And then looking at other forms, the driving we’ve talked about before. A very slight increase in walking. Public transport remains largely flat. So evidence, I think, that the great majority of people are continuing to honor the lockdown, which is helping us to drive the number of cases down and therefore take pressure off the NHS. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Professor Chris Whitty: (10:44);The next few slides are really ones that people who watch these briefings will be very familiar with. It’s just the most recent data. So new cases in the UK. As you can see, obviously one thing we have to bear in mind is the number of tests is going up overall, but despite that the trend is flat or slightly down in terms of positive cases. Next slide please. But when we actually look at people in hospital, I think the trends that demonstrate that over the country as a whole, we’re going through the peak are reasonably clear to see. Obviously a bigger fall in London, but the rest of the country in different areas are either flat or decreasing over time. Next slide please. And then when we turn to one of the most important questions, which is critical care capacity, if you look at these trends across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, these are the percentage of all critical care beds being used for covid patients and both in absolute and in relative terms this is gradually trending down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Professor Chris Whitty: (11:55);But importantly, and I talked about this last time I was here, this is a very gradual peak. We’re not seeing a dramatic falloff and nor do we expect to in the next short while. Next slide please. And finally, sadly, people are continuing to die as we have said. Every time just after a weekend, there’s an artificial drop because there’s less notification over weekends. So the number of cases who sadly were reported as having died yesterday with 360 I do actually expect there will be a bit of an uptick again later in the week as we catch up from the weekend drop. Nevertheless, the trend overall, as you can see from the seven day rolling average at the top, which smooths out these weekend effects, is a gradual decline. But we are definitely not consistently past the peak across the whole country at this point in time. Finally, a slide which compares different countries, and again I would be really clear that we should not over-interpret the absolute numbers. The way these are actually measured in different countries is different, but the trend lines I think are reasonably clear from this. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (13:14);Thank you very much Chris. Now we’re going to go to the first question, which is from Lynn in Skipton. And I’m going to read out the question, and I’m reading it for the first time, and then we will endeavor to answer it. I’m missing my grandchildren so much. Please can you let me know if after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown. Well, thank you Lynn for that question. An incredibly important one and brings home the emotional impact of the lockdown measures. I think why don’t we take the direct medical evidence from the chief medical officer?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Professor Chris Whitty: (13:59);Well very clearly for most people, the ability to actually interact with families in a way that they have not been able to during this period is absolutely essential. In terms of the direct answer to this lady’s question, it depends, if I’m honest, on the situation that she finds herself in. So if she is someone who has a significant medical problem in a way that means that she would have to be shielding that is, and she’s an older person. Some grandparents are younger grandparents, some obviously are older. If she’s in a group which is vulnerable, then the answer is that it might well be prudent, and this will be depend entirely on individual circumstances, for her not to get into a situation where she is putting herself at risk. Obviously if she’s healthy and younger, that may well not be true, but the overall view that actually one of the things that clearly is important to everybody is the ability to get together with families remotely, but also physically everyone fully accepts. Nevertheless, it is important that people who are vulnerable continue to be protected even after whatever the next steps are occur."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (15:16);Thank you. And the thing I’d say to Lynn directly is that we understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. It affects all of us too, as well as the direct health impacts of the lockdown, bringing down the curve and trying to stop this terrible disease. And also the economic impacts, which are clearly very significant. There are also the direct emotional bonds because it’s one of the most natural things in the world to want to hug a member of a family. And we just hope we can get back to that as soon as possible. And the best way we can get there fastest is for people to follow the rules so we can get those five…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (16:03);… is for people to follow the rules so we can get those five criteria met as soon as possible. I don’t know if you wanted to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 2: (16:07);I have only to add that we all know how hard this is. My own mother lives hundreds of miles away and I know she’s wondering when she will be seeing me and her grandchildren again. This is really tough, but as the Secretary of State have said, it is bearing fruit in that we are seeing reduction in the number of hospital admissions. We’re seeing a reduction in the number of deaths, and it’s only by the British public continuing to comply with that guidance until the time is right that we will all continue to see a reduction in deaths, which I know has touched so many people around the country in terms of loved ones."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (16:43);Thank you very much, Lynn, for your question and for submitting it. And I hope that, I think that’s shown that the questions from the members of the public can be just as informative and can be just as difficult to answer as questions from journalists who are trained to ask them. Talking of which Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Hugh Pym: (17:11);Thank you very much. Question for the Secretary of State. It’s about testing particularly important in the short term, at least for up to 10 million key workers and their families. We’re hearing varying reports on how easy it might be or not to book tests online. What do you say to that and do you think you will hit your target of a hundred thousand tests a day by the end of this month? That’s later this week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (17:35);Well, thank you. I think we are on track to the hundred thousand target. We’re broadly where we expected to be. You’ve seen a big increase over the weekend to 37,000 tests yesterday. Now we are also enhancing and making it easier to access how you get a hold of tests. The home tests have been particularly popular. We delivered 5,681 of those yesterday. And that is all about being able to make the testing as easy for people who, if you’ve got symptoms you’re by the nature of the thing you are already ill, and so we want to make it as easy as possible to get hold of those tests, alongside it still we’re opening more and more drive through centers. So we’re broadly where we expected to be and we’ve got a lot of work the rest of this week to keep continuing the ramp up to the goal that I so clearly set up. Thanks, Hugh."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Hugh Pym: (18:43);Can I ask a follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (18:44);Yes, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Hugh Pym: (18:45);Beyond this it’s very important to escalate testing capacity significantly to prevent or help prevent a second spike. Where do you want to be with capacity and testing ability in a few months time? How many hundred of thousands a day?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (19:01);So this is a really important question and of course the reason that I set the goal and that we’re working so hard towards it is because testing is an important part of how we keep the spread of the virus down, especially once we’ve got the number of new cases down through the social distancing measures. So we want testing to continue to increase. As you’ll know, the Prime Minister set a goal of 250,000 sometime ago, especially for when the antibody tests come on stream. But so far there isn’t one of those that is clinically valid. So we’ll keep on increasing. It’s important to note that we’ve already gone past the number of tests per day, for instance, that they carry out in South Korea. We’re approaching the levels that Germany undertakes. So, it’s a project to keep increasing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (20:06);Also, we need to think very hard and take the clinical advice on how to use those tests. For instance, we’re putting far more into care homes. We’re making sure that now NHS staff get tested, including when they’re asymptomatic, to make sure that we understand where the people who are working in hospitals have got the virus and using the tests for surveys. The Office for National Statistics have got a survey for instance in the field right now and with people being tested this week to find out how many people have got the virus, how many have had the virus, the critical questions that we need to know the answers to. So I don’t know if you want to add anything Chris, but the point is, it’s a really important question because testing is a critical part of controlling the virus once we get the number of new cases down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (21:07);Only thing to add is that the more testing capacity you’ve got them, the more flexibility you have to do different things, with both the patients and in terms of things like care homes as the Secretary of State was saying."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (21:19);Thanks, Hugh. Robert Peston ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Robert Peston: (21:23);Good afternoon. On the life insurance scheme, will overseas healthcare workers working in the NHS and those who come back to the NHS temporarily, will they qualify for this life insurance? Right now they don’t for example, qualify for normal death in service benefits. And the question I think largely for Chris Whitty, more or less the most important test you’ve set is the transmission rate, the so called R has to fall to a 0.5 so in language you can all understand on average it will take two infected people to infect one other person. What’s the magic of that 0.5? Why does it give you comfort? And also since we still don’t know how many people are walking around with funny symptoms or no symptoms at all who have the virus, how can you be remotely confident that you will get there. Neil Ferguson said he thinks that the number is currently O.6 to O.7, but how can we possibly be confident of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (22:24);I’ll take first question, Robert. The answer is yes. This is for frontline staff working in the NHS and in social care, who die and are employees within the NHS and social care. And as I say, we’re also looking at which other groups of key workers that applies to and who don’t have a scheme already in place. Chris?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (22:52);0.5, can I just correct? I don’t recall ever saying that the target was 0.5. What I have said is that it’s in the range 0.5 to one at the present time, probably somewhere in the middle of that range. And the second thing which I have said is that it is really important we do not go above one. That one is an absolute target. And the reason for that is that once it goes above one for any prolonged period of time, I mean it might just flick up for a short period, then you go back to exponential growth and then a short sooner or later, depending on how much above one it is, you get back to the situation, the NHS is threatened to be overwhelmed because exponential growth goes from very small numbers to very large numbers very fast."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (23:33);So I would like to clarify that it’s not going above one is the longterm target. Clearly the lower we can get it at the moment the better. But as I say, it’s probably in the middle of the range 0.5 to one at the present and that is bringing down the R, which is what you’re actually seeing when you look at the critical care and other metrics we looked at in the slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (23:56);Thanks very much. Yeah, or course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Robert Peston: (23:59);Could I? One extra thing, actually just on the life insurance, and just to be clear, there’s nothing in this life insurance scheme that would waive the rights of the families of individuals who get COVID and either die or are seriously injured from suing the NHS in the traditional way if they feel they haven’t been properly protected, particularly in the absence, they might feel appropriate PPE, there’s no waiving of their standard employment rights involved in any of this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (24:31);No. Beth Rigby from SKY."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Beth Rigby: (24:36);Thank you. Professor Whitty, at the beginning of the lockdown. Sir Patrick suggested a death toll below 20,000 was a good outcome. Now hospital deaths are suddenly above 21,000, and that doesn’t even include care home or community deaths. How have you had to change your expectations as the disease has progressed? And can you provide an updated expectation of what you think a more realistic number is now? And Secretary of State, you’ve promised a hundred thousand tests by Thursday and last week you said trace and track was key to ease in social distancing measures. What level of testing do you need to get track and trace up and running and what’s your timeframe for that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (25:24);Yeah, go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (25:27);So on the first one, the number will definitely see 20,000. So even with hospital deaths, as you say, sadly it has gone above that. Once we look into direct and indirect and I constantly make this point, it is really important direct and indirect deaths all cause mortality. We definitely sadly do expect it to exceed that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (25:51);I think that my view actually is we need to view this epidemic over the long run. And this has got a very long way to run. And I’m really cautious about putting out, and I’ve said this again repeatedly, these kinds of absolute numbers because this could go in a lot of different ways over the next many months until such time as we have a clear exit that has a vaccine or drugs or some other route that allows us to be able to say, “Look, we now couldn’t stop people dying from this.” And this is going to be true, to be clear, in every country around the world. So I’m really cautious about putting these absolute numbers, but I am absolutely clear also that the 20,000 number is not where we will be once we add in the direct and indirect causes both in and out of hospital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (26:39);And on the question on test, track and trace, it’s all a matter of degree and the lower the number of new cases, the more effective a system of test, track and trace of any scale is. And therefore a hundred thousand tests a day is a big enough testing system to start test, track and trace. But if it’s bigger, then the system can work on a higher number of cases and be more effective. South Korea is a really good example where they peaked in terms of tests today just over 20,000 and they’ve now brought that down because their number of new cases is so much lower. They can test everywhere they want and they still don’t need to use up all of the tests that they have the capacity for."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (27:31);And we’ve seen over the last few weeks that the gaps between capacity and the number of tests done in this country as well, and on Sunday the new German Ambassador to the UK was explaining that the test capacity in Germany is 800,000 a week. And they used 450,000 of that capacity each week. So we have a similar pattern of the capacity being higher than tests use all around the world. And the capacity that we’re building is big enough to get started on test, track and trace."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (28:12);We need to get the track and the trace part of that up and running so that they can be effective as we bring the number of new cases down."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Beth Rigby: (28:25);Can I just follow up just on one thing. Professor Whitty, what explains the mismatch between where you thought the death toll would be at the beginning of the lockdown and where we are ending up a month in? What changed over the course of the past few weeks?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (28:43);I’ve never put an absolute number into the public domain. I’ve been asked this lots of times. My aim has always been to try and get the number to be the minimum we can manage, but to be clear this has got a very long way to run. And I think just thinking about the first peak, which due to the fantastic work the whole nation has done and the work of the NHS, we have actually managed to go through, we still got some way before it’s falling right off, but there is a long, long way to go beyond that. And I think it’s a big mistake in my view just to consider just the first phase. We need to look at the epidemic as a whole."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (29:18);Thanks very much, Beth. Gary Gibbon from Channel 4."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Gary Gibbon: (29:23);Professor Whitty, can I follow up on what Robert Peston was asking about on the infection rates? If we’re in the middle of the 0.5 to one range, will that do? Is that good enough, or is it actually the rate that you need to get clearance to a relaxation of the rules is lower than that, is perhaps around 0.5?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (29:49);Well, clearly the lower the R just to remind people who don’t watch this program the whole time. This is if R is one, one person gives it to one person and the disease is stable, if R is 0.5, 10 people give it to five and so on, it’s going down and if it’s two, one person gives it to two give it to four and so on. That was just a clarification for people watching. The further away the R is from one and on the downside, so the closer it is, the lower it is the better, for two reasons. The first of which is that it will mean that the peak will fall away faster and we’ll get down to small numbers at a quicker rate. That’s a good thing, clearly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (30:33);But the second thing is the larger the gap between where the R is, the current force of the transmission and one, the greater room for maneuverabilities in terms of trying to think through when ministers have to look at things in terms of what could be reintroduced without threatening the risk that we could go back above one and start going back to exponential growth."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (30:55);So we know what we’ve currently measured indirectly, but I think that there’s a reasonable degree of confidence that it’s in that broader range 0.5 to one and I think it’s probably in a rather narrower range in the middle of that. Obviously if it was lower that would give us more room for maneuver, but it gives some room for maneuver, but it doesn’t give a huge amount of room for maneuver. And that’s one of the things that we ministers are going to have to consider is how to actually make sure we keep the R below one given where we are at the moment, thanks to what everybody is doing. But you know there isn’t a magic number here. Lower is better, but it’s not that there is a specific number that has to be the right number."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Gary Gibbon: (31:33);May I ask a quick second? What’s your current estimate of what R naught is measuring in hospitals and care homes?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (31:42);I think at the moment it’s quite difficult to separate those two out. It is very clear it is falling in hospitals. Where it is in terms of care homes I think is less easy to work out at this point. We’ve got ONS data coming out tomorrow, which may help a bit, but we’re not measuring that directly, I have to say and-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (32:03);Which may help a bit, but we’re not measuring that directly I have to say. And what I think we’re seeing across the country is some care homes, weather significant outbreaks and other care homes which are unaffected, it’s not like the community are, which is much more heavily influenced by the whole of the population. It’s much more local to particular areas and particular care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (32:22);And maybe Steve could answer on the NHS point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 4: (32:24);Yeah, so in hospitals it’s clear that the number of people who are tasting positive in hospitals is falling and therefore infection rates are falling. We would expect that because we’re now in a position where the community spread of the virus is less and therefore that will translate into lower spread in people coming into hospital and therefore in hospitals as well. As Chris said, I think care homes think differently in terms of approach to that, but in hospitals it’s clear that the infection rate is falling."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (32:55);Thanks very much Garry. Sebastian Payne of the FT."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Sebastian Payne: (33:00);Thank you very much Mr. Hancock. There were reports over the weekend that in the second phase of fighting the coronavirus the government is planning to quarantine people arriving in the UK for 14 days. I was wondering what changed your mind about tighter border restrictions and does that mean you’re going to be encouraging British families to holiday at home this year? And if I can ask a question for professor Witty, could you give us an update on antibody testing please and whether the government has seen any breakthrough in its assessments for those tests?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (33:30);Thanks so much. On the borders, we’ve been very clear that we follow the science and given the current level of infections, level of new cases in the UK and the very low amounts of international travel that’s going on right now, it is clear that the impact on the epidemic as a whole of the number of people coming through the borders as a proportion is very low. But as we bring the number of new cases down in the UK, that proportion coming from those who are traveling internationally will rise and that means that the judgment on the measures that you need at the border changes. And we’ve seen a number of countries go through this process and we’ll have more to say about it in due course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (34:26);On the testing point I don’t know whether you want to go into that? But the antibody tests is still something that we work on. We have now lab based antibody tests in fact in the field now the office for national statistics survey is based on lab based antibody tests. But we’re yet to find what’s called a lateral flow, which means a test you can take, you don’t need to send a sample to a lab because it gives you the result on the stick. We’re yet to find one that has a clinical level of results that we’re confident in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (35:06);I mean, my view is it sounds very seldom moves forward by breakthroughs. It moves forward by small incremental changes that over time significantly improve things. That is what I think will happen with this antibody test. We currently have tests that are good enough to give us a first pass at arranging shot on surveys to give us a feel for how many people in the community overall may have been infected. Some of them without knowing it because there’s certainly some transmission without people actually getting symptoms. But an antibody test that is good enough actually to be able to say to an individual we’re confident either yes you’ve had it or we’re confident no you have not, we have not yet got to that stage and I think it’s unlikely to happen in a single leap. It’s likely to happen in a series of small improvements that get us to a point where we feel sufficient confidence we can do that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Sebastian Payne: (35:56);Thank you. Mr. Hancock, could I just ask a follow up please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (35:58);Sure."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Sebastian Payne: (35:59);You mentioned earlier you were encouraging people that if they’ve got heart pains or worried about serious illness to go to hospital. Has the government done any work to measure some of the health side effects of the lockdowns such as its impact on mental health or domestic violence and will that play any part in your decision on how to ease the lockdown measures? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (36:20);Yes we have and one of the striking things around the world is that far fewer people are coming forward to use health services including here far fewer people are coming forward to use non-covid services in the NHS. I’ll ask professor Powers to elaborate because he’s been doing a lot of the work on this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 4: (36:46);Yes. So secretary of state said and as Chris said earlier, one of the things that we have concerns around are the indirect deaths I.e Deaths at home that is not related specifically to infection with COVID-19. And that’s why for some weeks now we’ve all been reminding everybody that if you do have a condition which might be a heart attack, chest pain, symptoms that might be a stroke, then don’t forget that the NHS is still there for you. The emergency services are there and always have been there throughout this. And also these are conditions where it’s important not to wait because treatment and diagnosis and treatment speed is of the essence and we can do many things for those conditions now, but we need to do it quickly. So the message to the public is come forward, the NHS is working if you have a sick child, if you have those symptoms. I think in the longterm we will only be able to tease this out as we start to look at excess deaths overall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 4: (37:47);Chris has mentioned that I think earlier today and of course comparisons between countries in terms of excess deaths will be important as well. But we do know that attendance [inaudible 00:37:57] departments are done. There’s reasons that that might be the case, but there are reasons why we want to encourage people to come forward if they have emergency symptoms that might need emergency treatment. So I think it will become clearer over time. But the key message for the public is the NHS is there for you come forward as you always would if you’ve got symptoms or one of your loved ones has got symptoms that might need emergency treatment."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (38:26);Thanks very much. So Gordon Rayner from The Telegraph."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Gordon Rayner: (38:31);Thank you secretary of state. Professor Witty, you said in March that children only got mild symptoms of coronavirus, which you said was a silver lining. While Sir Patrick [inaudible 00:38:43] said closing schools would have a minimal effect on the spread of the virus so it was safe to keep them open and there was zero chance of children avoiding contact with each other anyway. To what extent has your advice on sending children to school changed? Have you worked out the effect on the R value of sending children back to school? And also do you believe that children can spread coronavirus to other children following reports at the weekend that perhaps they couldn’t and just very quickly, secretary of state, you’ve just announced good news for a lot of people that hospitals are going to start taking in cancer patients and doing other non-emergency work. Can you give us more detail on that and would people be watching this be wrong to interpret that as the start of an easing of the lockdown?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (39:27);Great, do you want to take the first one and then I’ll ask Steve to comment on it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (39:32);So it remains the case that the great majority of children either don’t get coronavirus or if they do the symptoms are minor. That doesn’t mean sadly that that is absolutely true. There are still a small number of cases including some very severe cases, but they are relative to adults they’re much less than adults. So that remains absolutely the case. So the first reason for not sending children to school, which is it’s particularly dangerous for them, that wouldn’t be true in the case of coronavirus. Secondly, there is no doubt that they contribute. If you have schools open, it does contribute to increasing the R, so if you close schools the R goes down. It’s part of the collection of things that were done in March to try and pull the R from where it was near three to where it is now below one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (40:28);It’s only one off, if you did it just on its own, it wouldn’t be enough. But if you stopped doing it, you would actually lose some of the benefits that we’ve currently got. Now, there is quite a debate at the moment around the world in science what contribution do children make to the actual spread of this virus between families around the country, wherever we’re talking about. And is it different, for example, between young children and older children? Which it may be. But unfortunately we do not yet have direct data that really helps us remembering that this is a new disease so we can give a reasonably accurate answer for disease like flu. We really understand how children help drive flu. We’re still really learning on this one. And so whilst I think it remains the case that we think that the contribution of children at school to the spread of this virus is probably less than, for example, for flu."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (41:25);We do think it certainly contributes and what we’re trying to work out is what proportion of the R it contributes and therefore if children went back to school how much closer to one and that’s in a bad way, would we be? And could it even tip us above one and what can we do if so to try and minimize that? So it’s a very good question to which there is unfortunately not a really clear answer. But we are getting closer I think to having a slightly narrower range of uncertainty around this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (41:55);Thanks Chris. On the restoration of the NHS, we’ve always said throughout that people should come forward for medical treatment. So people’s access to the NHS, access to medical treatment has never been locked down. Indeed it’s one of the four reasons that you should leave your house if you need to. And what we can do though is because we now have the capacity in the NHS to be able to start reopening some services we can do that. And I’ll ask Steve to answer the question about with more detail, but it will be locally determined according to what capacity there is locally. But our message to people watching this and reading the Daily Telegraph is that the NHS is open and there to help you as it always is. And so people, if they think they need medical treatment from the NHS, then they should come forward in the first instance by phoning up their GP or going to their GP online calling one on one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 4: (43:02);Yeah so as the secretary of state says we are now in a position to start undertaking some of the services that we may have had to have stepped down to manage the surging coronaviruses or occasionally where services have become disrupted. So for instance, I know cancer patients there may be good clinical reasons why treatment might be delayed during a time when there is a lot of circulating virus in the community. And again as we’ve both said, emergency services have been there all along and it’s really important that people access them. But I think to answer your question directly, it’s not at all a sign that the lockdown is about to be relaxed. In fact, I think it’s the reverse. It’s a sign that the lockdown and the measures that have been taken and the fact that everybody’s following them has meant that we are now seeing a decline in patients in hospital with COVID-19 and it’s exactly that that is providing the capacity once again, that means that we can get back to restarting services such as elective surgery."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 4: (44:09);So I think the message shouldn’t be now is the time to relax. The message should be that by continuing to comply with these instructions, it will continue to help the NHS as we start to get over the peak and the plateaus to a point where we can get much more back to the services that unfortunately we’ve had to delay over the last few weeks as we’ve managed this surge."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Gordon Rayner: (44:33);And can I just ask you a quick follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (44:34);Of course yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Gordon Rayner: (44:36);Just on the school’s question, I mean listening to that answer that professor Witty gave a lot of people I think listening to this would interpret that as being in that there still isn’t really a plan in place for how schools are going to go back. Would it be wrong to infer that from what you’re saying?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (44:55);Well Chris, what I’d say it’s still as we’ve said over and over again too early to make decisions on this and people should follow the social distancing rules of staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives. And in a way, what we’ve been saying today about the restarting of hospital treatments, NHS treatments and the encouragement of many people to come forward when they haven’t been coming forward with non-covid health problems is all part of protecting the NHS, which has been made possible by the fact that we’ve flattened the curve thanks to the social distancing measures. So it should be seen in that light, in that context. But on the school specifically Chris, do you want to answer?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (45:47);So I think starting with the obvious point that obviously the final decisions will be for ministers and this is not a scientific decision. But what we can contribute from the science side is to say well look we’ve got this room for maneuver between where the R is now and one. And there’s a lot of things to contributing which everyone’s doing to pulling that down. Schools are contributing some of that and it may be different between different bits of schools and what we’re trying to do in very, very short order is try and give a kind of feel for what are the combinations of different things which actually still keep the R below one, which is an absolutely critical thing but allow opening up different bits of society and different bits of which schools is one."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (46:35);But I think the decision about how the different combinations go together, that finally is one for ministers. And I know the secretary of state would completely agree with that. What we can do is help provide some data to help say, here are some combinations of things we can do. But, and I really want to be clear about this, there is no perfect solution where we are going to end up being able to do all the things that people want and at the same time keep R below one. So there are going to have to be some very difficult choices between different things, all of which ideally all of us would love to open up, but we can’t do them all. And therefore there will have to be some difficult choices and choices around schools clearly will be one of those."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (47:15);Is that okay, Gordon?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Gordon Rayner: (47:17);Yes thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (47:19);Great. We’ve got David Walsh from the Sheffield Star"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","David Walsh: (47:23);Hello secretary of state. The raise the bar campaign wants to increase the threshold over 25,000 pounds retail hospitality unless you’re a grant from 51,000 pounds reasonable value, to 150,000. In Sheffield city center this would mean a further 157 businesses can benefit from additional 3.9 million pounds of support. This could save businesses and jobs unless [inaudible 00:47:55]. A second one for the secretary of state please, Sheffield is famous for its independent breweries…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","David: (48:02);Sheffield is famous for its independent breweries. It has more per capita than anywhere in the country and was enjoying a golden age prior to the crisis. The government’s supporting them in time, but with no opening date yet for pubs and bars, their very existence is under threat. To get them back on their feet, will the government council [inaudible 00:48:22] the six months when they’re allowed to restart operations."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (48:28);Well, thanks David. I understand, especially coming from a small business background myself, just how important these questions are to the businesses in the Central Sheffield and the breweries, which have, as you say, been flourishing right across the country over the past few years and have obviously been very hard hit by social distancing, by its nature, which takes away the ability to go for a pint with friends. So I will take these away and talk to the chancellor about them. What I would say is his announcement today of 100% guaranteed loans for smaller businesses is another important step in supporting businesses to get through this. We recognize the importance of supporting businesses right across the board, whether they’re in the town center breweries or others who are badly hit by this. Supporting businesses through it is critical because both the health impact of the measures and the economic impact are both best served by people staying at home because that saves lives but will also get the rate of transmission down as fast as possible, which will then allow us to get through this as soon as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (49:56);So we want to get through it as soon as possible and we want to support businesses on the way through and those two specific ideas, it’s tempting to say yes to as health secretary, but I think that I need to talk to the chancellor. Thanks very much. Dave West from the HSJ."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Dave West: (50:17);Hi. Thank you. First question for Mr. Hancock. Could you tell us a bit more about the restoration of general planned services in the NHS? And there are millions people on the waiting list for general operations or appointments, hip replacements or cataracts and things. What sort of timeframe would you expect that kind of general activity to be getting back to normal? Might it be region by region and what role do those Nightingale hospitals have to play in that which you mentioned? And second question if I can for Chris or Steven. This morning, HSJ revealed the warning to doctors about the small numbers of children who are becoming seriously ill with an unusual set of symptoms which the experts believe may be an emerging symptom linked to coronavirus. Do you think this may be a new feature of the outbreak or are you pretty confident that these are simply cases of the very small number of serious cases of coronavirus which we do see in children?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (51:20);Thank you. I’m very worried about the latter and we are looking into it closely. I’ll ask Steve to answer on that. On the restoration, this will be a locally driven approach system by system. Of course the principles are that the most urgent treatment should be brought back first and also that it needs to be according to the local demands on the system. There’s parts of the country where their number of COVID patients as a proportion is much lower than in other parts. And so it has to be locally driven. Unfortunately, I can’t give you a sort of concrete single number answer to when and it is gradually over weeks but starting from tomorrow. Steve?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Steve: (52:10);Yes, thanks Dave. Yeah, so as you’ve referred to, we have become aware in the last few days of reports of severe illness in children, which might be a Kawasaki like disease. So Kawasaki diseases is a very rare inflammatory condition that occurs in children. The cause is not often known, can be related to a number of things. So it’s only in the last few days as I say that we’ve seen those reports and I know you reported that in the Health Service Journal this morning. So both Chris and I are aware of that. We have asked our experts, I’ve asked the National Clinical Director for Children, Young People to look into this as a matter of urgency. I know the secretary of state is concerned as he said, I know public health England, they’re also looking into this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Steve: (52:55);So it’s obviously important that when clinicians see these cases and worry that there might be a cluster, they alert other clinicians so that we can make sure that they are identified if they’re occurring elsewhere and then quite rightly, we ask our experts to look into them and to see whether they can establish any link."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Steve: (53:16);We’re not sure at the moment. It’s really too early to say whether there is a link, but what I should say as we said already this afternoon is our advice to parents is that these are the sort of diseases, very, very rare. If you are worried about a child who is becoming sick and not recovering, then do remember to contact 111, talk to GP or an emergency contact 999 because the emergency services in the NHS are there for sick children and it’s important for this and other conditions. Although very rare, I must emphasize rare, that you come forward to seek treatment and diagnosis as quickly as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (53:55);Thanks Steve. Chris Whitty."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Chris Whitty: (53:57);Just really to reinforce what Steve said, this is a very rare situation but I think it is entirely plausible that this is caused by this virus at least in some cases because we know that in adults who of course have much more disease than children do, the big problems are caused by an inflammatory process and this looks rather like an inflammatory process, a rather different one, but therefore given that we’ve got a new presentation of this at a time with a new disease, the possibility, it’s not definite, we need to look for other causes as well. But the possibility that there is a link is certainly plausible. But back to Steve’s overriding point, numbers are very small. Key thing is if parents are worried then phone up and get advice. Very rare."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 6: (54:40);Ask a very quick follow up on the restoration."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (54:42);Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 6: (54:44);The NHS needed to free up about 30,000 beds to ensure it was ready to deal with the first peak and has been able to do so but has he used a lot of capacity and that’s rearranged a lot of things. How many is it going to need to keep open in case of a second peak or other returns of the virus because that’s clearly going to be a big constraining factor along with the staff who staff the beds on what it can get through back to normal."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (55:09);Well, one of the principles of the tests we’ve sat before we make any adjustments to the social distancing measures is that we shouldn’t risk a second peak for many, many reasons. The direct impact of course, but also because a second peak would mean that we would have to halt the restoration of the NHS for non COVID treatments and that has an impact itself on the health of the nation as Chris Whitty first set out several weeks ago in terms of the indirect death rate. So we’ve got to make sure that we don’t have that second peak. Therefore, the NHS is of course making sure that it can reopen where that locally is appropriate given the local amount of pressure on the system and also take into account the Nightingale hospitals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (56:08);In fact, I’m going to answer a question that was asked previously by Beth Rigby I think, but I didn’t answer, which is that the Nightingale’s are not going to be used for non coronavirus purposes because they are precisely set up and designed to deal with people who are intubated and are sedated. But the fact that they’re there does help us to restore more of the core NHS and get that going as much as possible. Were you coming in again?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Speaker 6: (56:46);I was just going to say very funnily would you see them all the Nightingale hospitals, all seven or I think it’s seven or eight now to be used in that way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (56:55);In the first instance, yes, but as we go through this we always keep things like this open to review to work out what’s the best way to use the resources at the nation’s disposal. Steve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Steve: (57:08);Yeah, so I think the Nightingale’s in specifically have been a very important part of the flexibility that the NHS has put in place to manage the surge. Remember, it’s only a few weeks ago that we were really concerned that we would see a surge in patients, particularly those that needed critical care that would go beyond even the surge capacity we could put in place in our existing critical care facilities by surging into theaters and recovery areas. So the Nightingale’s I think are real proof that the NHS can be agile and flexible and can change its model of care in a very short period of time. Clearly, we want to keep them there because although the peak is reducing, we still feel that we need to have them there as the insurance policy for COVID patients."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Steve: (57:55);But as we go forward, we will be keeping them under review as the secretary of state has said and of course we’re only into the first week or so of coming off a plateau and a peak. And as you would expect all that work, again, as the secretary of state has indicated is being done at the moment to plan capacity going forward. And the restoration of services is a really important part of that, which I’m absolutely sure will occur hospital by hospital and region by region because infection rates are a bit different everywhere and because different organizations have stacked up to manage the surge in slightly different ways. But the key point is that we are now in a position to bring those services increasingly back on stream."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-27","Matt Hancock: (58:38);If you’d asked me a month ago, Dave, whether we would be having this discussion now about the restoration of those parts of the NHS that we had to pause in order to put capacity towards treating coronavirus. And the question is, how much NHS capacity do we need to keep in hand in case there’s a second outbreak, which we don’t want to risk. And that the NHS had not in the meantime, been at all overtopped by demand in any instance, then I think we’d be … If you told me that a month ago, I would be very pleased with where we’ve come to on the NHS capacity because that is absolutely core to the principles of this country is that if you need NHS treatment, then you get it. And we’ve managed to keep that principle throughout this vast crisis. Okay. Thank you very much indeed. That concludes our Downing street briefing for today."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (00:00);And by deputy chief scientific advisor, Angela McLean. This morning at 11:00 o’clock, we paused to remember the 85 NHS colleagues and the 19 colleagues from social care who’ve lost their lives with coronavirus. It was a solemn moment of reflection for so many of us, and of unbearable sadness for some. These are the nation’s fallen heroes and we will remember them. Every day we’re working through our plan to protect life and to protect the NHS, slowing the spread and building capacity so that the NHS, at all times, can offer the very best care to everybody because we’ve got the beds and the ventilators and the staff available."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (00:53);So far, thanks to the incredible work of NHS colleagues and the shared sacrifice of everyone who’s at home, that plan is working. The latest figure show 3,260 spare critical care beds across the NHS. On the most recent figures, there’ve been 763,387 tests for coronavirus so far in the UK, including 43,453 yesterday. 161, 145 people have tested positive, an increase of 3,996. 15,796 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus. 21,678 have now sadly died in hospital, an increase of 586 since yesterday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (01:54);This morning, the office for national statistics and the CQC published more information on the overall impact, including that there have been 4,343 notified deaths in care homes since Easter. The proportion of coronavirus deaths in care homes is around a sixth of the total, which is just below what we see in normal times. I want to make sure that we bring as much transparency as possible to important information like this. And so from tomorrow, we’ll be publishing not just the number of deaths in hospital each day, but the number of deaths in care homes and in the community too. This is something that wasn’t previously possible. This will supplement the ONS and CQC weekly publication and all add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day, and it’ll help inform the judgements that we make as we work to keep people safe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (02:59);Behind every single death is a family’s heartbreak, and we must do everything humanly possible to save as many lives as we can. We will not be changing the social distancing rules until our five tests have been met, the NHS protected, infection rates falling, the number of deaths falling substantially, the operational challenges around testing and PPE addressed and no risk of a second spike."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (03:32);I want to update you on two other issues of major importance. First on testing. At the start of the month, I set a goal of 100,000 tests a day. Every day, we’re ramping up this testing capacity on track to meet that goal. We’re continuously opening new drive-through centers. There are now 41 with 48 going live this week. For people who can’t get to the tests, we’re expanding home testing to bring the test to them. We’re increasing the dispatch of home test kits from 5,000 a day last Friday to 25,000 a day by the end of the week."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (04:12);At the weekend, 17 mobile testing units, manned by the army, were operational. By the end of the week, we plan to have over 70 deployed with trained crews right across the country. All of this has led to an increase in daily testing capacity, which now stands at 73,400, and this has allowed us progressively to expand access to testing. We started with hospital patients who’ve always have the access to tests right away through ramping up to include symptomatic NHS and social care colleagues and their households and then to all essential workers. Today, because we’ve been able to expand capacity, I can expand access further."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (05:04);Building on successful pilots, we’ll be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS. This will mean that anyone who is working or living in a care home will be able to get access to a test whether they have symptoms or not. I’m determined to do everything I can to protect the most vulnerable and we now have the capacity to go further still. So from now, we’re making testing available to all over 65s and their households with symptoms and to all workers who would have to leave home in order to go to work and members of their households, again, who have symptoms. So from construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing. The expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe and it’s possible because we’ve expanded capacity for testing thus far."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (06:20);Next, I want to update you on our COVID-19 therapeutics work. This is research to understand whether existing drugs could be used to treat people more effectively once they’ve developed the disease. Currently no drugs in the world have been clinically proven to treat COVID-19, but our therapeutics task force has identified a number of promising candidates. Currently, six different treatments have been entered into national clinical trials, and the first is ready to enter the next stage, a new early phase clinical trial platform that we’re launching today. This is a national effort made possible by government, academia, and industry all working together."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (07:01);In addition, we have to make the best possible use of all the medicines that we have. We’re updating the guidelines for the use of medicines in care homes, removing a barrier so that for the period of the pandemic, where it’s clinically appropriate, medicines that have been labeled for use by one patient can be used by another patient who needs them instead of being destroyed. Clinicians and colleagues in social care have called for this change and it’s already standard procedure in hospitals."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (07:32);Right across government, we’re working day and night to defeat this virus, ramping up testing capacity, investigating new drugs and treatments, backing vaccine development, securing and distributing billions of items of PPE, getting the NHS whatever resources it needs to make sure that it is always there to treat everybody who needs it. The risk of a second peak is real, but as a nation, we’re holding it at bay. So please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’m now going to turn to the deputy chief scientific advisor to take us through the daily charts. Angela."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (08:15);Thank you very much. If I could have the first slide please. I wanted to go into a bit more detail about the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. So the first of those is that the NHS shall have sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The second is that we should have seen a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from coronavirus. Number three says that we must have reliable data to show us that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. Fourth is that operational challenges, including testing and PPE, are in hand with supply able to meet future demand. And the fifth test is that we must be confident that any adjustments that we make to our current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (09:23);And if I could just have the next slide please, here is a description of transport use and how it has changed across Great Britain for a number of different ways of traveling. And it starts on the 16th of March on the left hand side and runs to Saturday, 26th of April. And what you see when you look at this data is how volumes of all kinds of traffic have fallen relative to how much travel there was in the first week of February. So in particular, we remain pleased to see that the use of public transport is below 20% for buses, the tube and national rail. And we just very much hope that all those people in motor vehicles who are not below 20% are practicing really excellent social distancing when they get it wherever it is that they’re going."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (10:22);Next slide please. We know that it’s been a lot of work for everybody, and this slide is new cases in UK between the 21st of March and the 28th of April. And what it shows is that that … So this is new positive tests. In dark blue is tests that happened in hospitals and in orange is additional testing that has become available for key workers. And what you see in that slide is how that number of positive tests rose very quickly through the latter part of March and has now stabilized. And the blue line, the numbers in hospital positive tests, is starting to fall, although because of the number of tests is still rising overall, we’re still getting about the same number of positive tests across the UK. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (11:26);This instead of counting test counts people. So this is people who are in hospital with COVID-19 again across the UK. And what you see is that overall, that has fallen by 14% in the last … I think it’s in the last week. Sorry, I’m looking for a date. It’s yes. Over the last week, that has fallen by 14%, particularly a dramatic fall in [inaudible 00:11:55] peaked early compared with the rest of the country, and several other regions of England now are clearly falling, although a few regions of England, that number of people in hospital, is still stable for now. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (12:15);This is critical care beds in which there is a patient with COVID-19. So this is two kinds of critical care beds, those in the high dependency wards and those in intensive care wards. And the four different lines are England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. And what you see is what percentage of those beds that can be used for critical care are occupied by a patient with COVID-19. Again, what you see is across all four nations, that has peaked and is beginning to fall as a percentage. Next slide please. We have to turn to how many people have died from COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (13:03);We have to turn to how many people have died from COVID. And our first way of counting that is daily COVID-19 deaths in hospital. So this is a slide that many of us would be familiar with. It’s the way we have been counting for more than a month now. When you look at that slide, the first thing you see is this, well, I guess the first thing you see is that the number of deaths in hospital has started to fall. It’s been falling for the last two weeks. You see that most easily by looking at the orange line. The orange line is a seven day rolling average. And the reason we use that is that there are these very strong weekend effects in these data. So what you see is that out of every seven days, there are always two days when it’s really low, followed by a day when it’s much higher. Because today is Tuesday, it’s higher today. Because on a Tuesday, we report results from a few days ago. I think the most important thing to see there is that the orange line is falling steadily. But this is just one of the ways that we can count how many people have died with COVID."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (14:11);Next slide please. This is a different way of counting the same thing. So this is all weekly registered deaths from COVID-19 across the UK compared with what I just showed you, the deaths in hospital. So let’s just look at the last bar, which is for the week leading up to the 17th of April. The dark blue bar is what we just looked at but summed up up to then. Whereas the pale blue bar is all weekly registered deaths. So that’s everybody, not just the people who died with COVID in hospital."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (14:47);If I could have the next slide, please. So what the next slide does is it takes the pale blue line that we just had and breaks it out into a number of different locations. So what you see is hospital is the right hand bar in a sort of smoky blue. Just the left of that is people who died with COVID in care homes. Just below that is people who died with COVID in their own home. And then the smallest bar is other locations. So what you can see here is that deaths from COVID are dominated by those deaths in hospital, but that is not the only location in which such deaths are seen. Next slide, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (15:41);The last slide for today compares UK deaths with those in other nations. So these lines are lined up against the first day when there had been a total of 50 deaths accumulated in each of these nations. And we have two different lines on there describing what’s happened in the UK. Towards the right hand side, you see a dark blue line labeled UK hospitals only. And that’s the data that we’ve been collecting and showing for a long time. So it’s people who have died with COVID in UK hospitals. Whereas a gray line further over to the left there is people who have died with COVID in the UK in all settings. And not surprisingly, if you count all settings, that line is higher than the people who died in UK hospitals. That’s the end of the data for today. Thank you very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (16:39);Thanks very much, indeed. As with yesterday. We’re now going to take questions from the public before turning to journalists. And the first, we’re going to take two questions today from the public. These are questions that, as with the questions from journalists, we don’t see an advance. The first I’ll read out from the screen and then the second is going to be relayed by video. So the first question is from Amanda from Hull and she asks, given that grandparents can not be used as childcare, what is the plan for easing the lockdown for full time working parents who have young children that may not be allowed to be in school on a full time basis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (17:23);And Amanda, this is a really good question. And the honest answer I can give you is that it is still too early to say when we’re going to be able to get schools to go back because there are still too many deaths each day. And the five tests that we set out haven’t been met. Now I know, especially as a father of three young children, that there’s a yearning from people to know when schools might go back. And of course it’s something that we think about and we talk about. And I’m sorry that I can’t give you a more definitive answer, but I can’t because we don’t yet have the number of deaths and the number of infections low enough for that to be safe to reopen the schools and we don’t yet know how fast the number of new cases will fall. And so we haven’t been able to make that decision yet. Angela, I don’t know if you want to add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (18:29);I’m not sure I do have anything to add on that. We are, of course, all of us, yearning for the number of deaths each day to fall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (18:38);Thank you, Amanda. Thank you for your question. And all I can say is that I hope we can be in a position to be able to give a definitive answer as soon as possible. And the best way to get there is for people, everybody watching, to stay at home in order to protect the NHS, to save lives, and to bring that curve down. Thank you, Amanda. Next question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Sadie: (19:03);Hi. My question is regarding my 10 year old son who has cystic fibrosis and autism. Apart from shielding, is there any other option for him and others in the extremely vulnerable category to return to school and be part of society again without a vaccine available?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (19:20);Thank you, Sadie. The answer to this is yes. We have made sure, in the school’s policy, that we’re working very hard to ensure that those who have extra needs, for instance, people with autism and cystic fibrosis, get that extra support. It is, of course, very, very hard though when that clashes with the medical needs which have to come first. And for those who are in the shielded category, I’m afraid that the safest thing for them to do is to be shielded, which is not just to stay at home, but really be protected from all contact because of the consequences should they get the disease."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (20:08);Yes. I think I agree. That’s right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (20:11);Thank you very much and thank you for your question. And of course, you mentioned a vaccine and we’re all working incredibly hard to try to get a vaccine as soon as possible. But again, the science behind that is uncertain and so the timings are uncertain. And thank you very much for those two questions from the public. I think that this is working well, having questions from members of the public. I’m very grateful to all those who have submitted and it’s something that we’re going to keep on doing. So thanks very much. And now we’ll turn to Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (20:46);Thank you very much. I wanted to raise the subject of PPE. I know it’s been discussed several times at this occasion before, but it’s still a talking point after Panorama and also a survey of doctors suggesting some are of concern still. What assurances can you give front line staff that there will be adequate supplies of PPE in the days and weeks ahead?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (21:08);Well, thank you, Hugh. The issue of PPE is incredibly important and making sure that there are the supplies of PPE so that everybody on the front line has the PPE and the protective equipment that they need. As you know, we’ve been moving heaven and earth to get the amount of PPE that we need to the frontline, both buying it from abroad and also then distributing it. That system is getting stronger all of the time, but it is a mammoth effort to do it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (21:44);I saw two of the things that you referred to, I’m not sure that they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation, but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the front line and we we take full responsibility to getting it to every single person who needs it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (22:08);Can I ask a quick follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (22:08);Yes, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Hugh Pym: (22:10);Can you assure staff that stocks are not running low at the moment?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (22:16);Well, I can assure staff that the PPE that we need according to the agreed guidelines, that is available. We’re constantly needing to buy more from abroad and to make more at home to make sure we’re constantly replenishing that. And that’s a huge effort. Globally, there’s a shortage of PPE because the demand for PPE, understandably, in so many countries has shot up. And therefore, we’re out buying it around the rest of the world. And I’m really glad that a whole host of factories here in the UK are turning over their production towards PPE. It’s incredibly important. It’s a huge amount of effort. And we’re working on it as hard as we possibly can. Thanks, Hugh. Paul Brand from ITV. We’ve lost your audio, Paul."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (23:18);Hopefully you can hear me now, Secretary."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (23:19);Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (23:20);Excellent. Given today’s statistics, Health Secretary, do you now recognize that while you’ve prevented the NHS from becoming overwhelmed, there is now a crisis in the care sector? And given that the number of deaths continues to go up in care homes each day, will it now be your main priority?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (23:38);Well, of course care homes have been a top priority right from the start. We put out our first guidance to care homes in February and we’ve been working with them throughout. Now, by their nature, care homes look after and support some of the most vulnerable people anyway. And they support some of the people who are most vulnerable to this disease as well because of the nature of the disease and how it impacts on, especially on older people much more than the rest of the population. So it’s been a focus from the start. We’ve strengthened the rules around what happens in care homes and improved infection control. And also making testing available throughout the care sector I think is incredibly important as we’ve ramped up the availability of testing."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (24:36);We keep a close eye on it and I’m very glad that we’re now able to publish these daily data, which will keep the focus on what’s happening in care homes. I asked for that to start and I think we talked about it a week or so ago and now we’ve got those data being collected so that we can focus on it day in, day out. And my principle in this is to be as transparent as possible because then you find problems as quickly as possible. And we-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Paul Brand: (25:07);You say that you’ll keep an eye on it, but carers are frustrated. And I understand this is a complex sector. There’s lots of private providers here. It’s not like the NHS. And that’s a fair point that you have often made. But given that the number of deaths in care homes continues to go up every day, surely this has to be your first priority now. This looks as though this is where the virus continues to spread."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (25:29);The spread of the virus through care homes is absolutely a top priority, yes. And on the testing, I think John Newton wanted to add something."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (25:36);Well, yes. I mean, it is absolutely right that care homes are a focus. And in fact, we’ve done some intensive studies of infection in care homes. And what that showed was that the presence of symptoms was not a very good marker in the care home setting, both amongst residents and staff, for the presence of the virus. So there were significant numbers of residents who were asymptomatic who had the virus. And so we’ve massively increased the amount of testing available. So we’ve now tested 25,000."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (26:03);The amount of testing available. So we’ve now tested 25,000 residents in care homes and we’re rolling out testing now to symptomatic and asymptomatic residents as well as providing testing through the drive incentives and through the other means that Secretary of State’s mentioned for staff. And we think that will really make a difference combined with intensive infection control methods informed by much more widely available testing. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (26:26);Thanks, John. Nick Martin from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (26:31);Very good afternoon. A question for all of you, but the health secretary first. I just want to clarify something you said in your introduction, Secretary of State. You said the proportion of corona deaths in care homes is around the sixth of the total. In week 16, which I think is ending April the 17th, care home deaths were actually 23% of the official COVID deaths. And of total deaths, not just COVID, closer to a third. Are you saying that the number of people who’ve died in care homes during this crisis is around in line with the number of deaths you would normally see in any other year?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (27:06);No, I’m absolutely not saying that latter point. What I was saying very clearly is that, in the statistics that have been published so far, the number of deaths from coronavirus in care homes is around a sixth in total. But of course the breakdown of the statistics, exactly as you say, shows that that proportion is changing and we’ve got to… So, I was putting it in the broad context, but also saying that it is an absolute focus of ours because it’s an area which you’ve highlighted many times in the past under an area where we’ve got a huge amount of focus. Thanks. Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (27:59);Could I just have a followup please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:00);Yes, of course. Of course, Nick."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (28:02);I’m so sorry."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:03);No problem."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (28:04);A lot of people have died in care homes. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. And you knew and your department knew that this was a high risk area. You have a huge guidance to care homes repeatedly over the last few months, and yet PP was inadequate, tests for the most part were few and far between, but yet the deaths in care homes seem to take you and your department by surprise. And this isn’t meant to be a clever, catch you out question at all, but I wonder if you will take this opportunity to apologize to those families of loved ones who died in care homes because the government didn’t properly protect them."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (28:45);The thing is, Nick, I think that’s unreasonable as a question, actually. And I know you care an awful lot about this, but, from the start, we know, we knew that there was a very significant challenge with care homes, not least because of the frailty of the residents and the enormous work that’s gone on within government, Public Health England, and local authorities, and the CQC to monitor this from the start. It has been more difficult to get data flowing, and I’m very glad we’re able to do that now on a daily basis instead of a weekly basis as before, and making sure that care homes have the support they need has been absolutely at front of mind right from the start."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (29:36);In fact, I can remember in one of the very early discussions about coronavirus in January, having a discussion about, because one of the first things we knew about this virus was that it had a very strong age profile, as in it was much more dangerous for older people. That immediately drew our attention to the fact that there was a big challenge in care homes, especially because people are more frail, and therefore they are more at risk. It’s something that we focused on right from the start and something that’s been a huge challenge throughout, and we’re constantly learning from what happens and trying to improve the way that we support people across the care sector."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (30:23);Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Nick Martin: (30:25);Secretary of State, why didn’t you bring in tests earlier? It just seems odd that it took a while for tests to come through. If you knew the risks and, as you just clearly said, why did it take you so long to give the sector what it was crying out for, and that was tests?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (30:41);Well, we have been testing in care homes right from the start and throughout the crisis. So that’s one of the things in your question that I dispute, and I know the passion that you have for this subject. But it is really important to base, for us to explain what’s been going on and we’ve been testing right from the start. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:02);It’s important to understand that, from the word go, Public Health England has been investigating any outbreaks of coronavirus in care homes. And the approach there would be to test a limited number, when test capacity was limited, we’re talking about beginning of April, test capacity was limited to test a number of index cases to clarify that it was an outbreak of coronavirus. Then the whole care home would be treated as if the symptomatic cases were all coronavirus and various measures were put in place, and no doubt many lives saved as a result."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:33);Obviously, now we have more testing and we have more knowledge about the way the virus spreads in care homes. We’re able to adapt that and we’ll be even more effective. But it would be wrong to say that testing was not available and not used. And it would also be wrong to say that nothing was done about these outbreaks. A great deal was done, but we’re confident we can be more effective now than in the past."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","John Newton: (31:52);The issue of care homes is an international one. Every country in Europe has had a significant problem with a large proportion of the deaths from coronavirus occurring in the care home sector. We are no different in that respect. And the care home sector is a highly distributed system. It’s intrinsically difficult to deliver services to that sector. But nevertheless, a huge effort has been made in collaboration with organizations like the Care Quality Commission and also local government. So a lot has been done. We all want to do more and we are, certainly with testing, we’re going to be able to do a lot more with this additional capacity that Secretary of State described. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (32:29);Thanks, Nick. Ben Kentish from LBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Ben Kentish: (32:33);Thank you. Good afternoon to you all. Secretary of State, I know you’ve said you’re following the science on this, but it’s been almost a week since your scientific advisors made a new recommendation in relation to the use of face masks, Scotland today becoming the latest country to recommend they are used in public places. Are you able to tell us about the deliberations you’re making on that, what the delay is, and when we’re likely to hear some sorts of ruling, some sorts of advice on that? And if I could also ask very quickly to Professor McLean another practical question. Experts in some countries have given very clear advice about stopping the spread of this disease from surfaces. I know you’ve recommended washing hands. But other countries, for example, are saying people should be disinfecting their washing, takeaway boxes, anything really coming into their house. Are you recommending British people do those sorts of things too? Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (33:24);They’re all questions to Professor McLean. What I’d say is that, on face masks, we are guided by the science, and the government position hasn’t changed. Professor McLean will explain the science. The UK Government position hasn’t changed, not least because this most important thing people can do is the social distancing as opposed to the weak science on face masks. There is very clear science on social distancing and the importance of it. So that is our absolute priority in terms of the message to the public, that the social distancing, staying at home is the thing that is helping to save lives by flattening the curve. That is the number one thing. Professor."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Professor McLean: (34:12);The recommendation from SAGE is completely clear, which is that there is weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent a source of infection of going from somebody who is infected to the people around them. Now of course under our current circumstances, anybody who has symptoms really must stay at home. And that’s the thing that people have done so brilliantly. But we are also concerned that some people are infected who don’t have symptoms or maybe don’t have symptoms yet, and that is the reason that SAGE has put so much effort into looking at this question. But the answer is clear that the evidence is weak and the effect is small. And we’ve passed that on to our colleagues in government with which to make a decision. Turning onto your question about hand washing and keeping surfaces clean, we have always absolutely been really majored on hand washing because that’s the way you keep the inside of your house and your family safe when you come in from outdoors. We would also recommend always keeping the surfaces in your house clean. That would seem like common sense to me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (35:27);Thanks very much. Thanks, Ben. The next question is from Dominic [Yaton 00:35:32] at the metro. Dominic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Dominic: (35:35);Hello, Secretary of State. You said that you knew from the start that there was a very significant challenge with care homes. So why were care homes not told to ban visitors until March the 16th? And why were figures on deaths outside hospitals not published until March 31st?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (35:57);The collection of the information from the care home sector has been more difficult than from the NHS by the distributed nature of the care system. There’s 15,000 care homes, and they’re part of 10,000 different organizations. And so, I’m glad we managed to get the data collection. On the point about visitors, that was based on clinical advice. And I’ll explain the reason that our clinical advisors gave us, which is that before there was a widespread incidence of coronavirus across the community as a whole, the critical thing is that, in a care home, having visitors also has a positive impact both against the loneliness of the residents but also on their longevity and their mental health. So these are difficult judgments and there are no easy recommendations to make. And so, absolutely, we are guided by that clinical advice."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (37:12);When it was necessary to make that change, which is quite a firm change, then we did so. So, I understand. Of course I understand the focus now on care homes and the questions from the media, but it’s something we’ve been working on incredibly hard right from the start. And really, one of the things that has happened in this crisis is that social care alongside the NHS have both been seen as these two absolutely vital parts of our society. And I think that that’s a good thing that we recognize and value them in that way. James Kayvan at the Daily Star."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","James Kayvan: (37:58);Hi. I just wanted to ask, first of all, there’s increasing frustration over what people see as mixed messaging from the government around the social distancing measures. On the one hand we’ve seen long queues at DIY stores, while on the other police are moving people on for sitting alone outside and sunbathing in parks. As increasing numbers of people return to work and roads get busier, can you give greater clarity what you can and can’t do outside the house?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","James Kayvan: (38:20);And second, if I can just ask, there’ve been reports that ventilator productions is now being scaled back just weeks after you called on British industry to build thousands for the NHS. Will we be in a situation soon where we have a huge supply of these machines [inaudible 00:38:33] demand? And I just wondered what’s going to happen with that supply and will the production of new ventilators continue to be scaled back or do you still want more for the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (38:42);Thanks very much, indeed. Look, on the clarity, I can absolutely give you that clarity, James, which is that people should follow the social distancing rules and they should stay at home if at all possible because that protects the NHS. And so far the protection of the NHS is working. And this brings me to the second point, which is that…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (39:03);This brings me to the second point which is that it is good news that there are spare ventilated beds available in the NHS. There has been no point when somebody’s needed a ventilator and a ventilator has not been available, a ventilated bed, because it’s more than just the ventilator machine, of course you need the people as well to use them. That has been one of the things in this crisis that people said right at the start, that preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed will be extremely difficult. Some people told me to my face it would be impossible, but that so far has worked, and now with the number of people in the NHS in hospital with coronavirus falling, we can see that we’ve managed to keep the NHS able to treat everybody who needs it. That brings to the question of ventilators. We are still, yes, producing those ventilators."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (39:54);There are countries across the world who are now needing them because their curve is in a different position, and so we’re still working with those companies who I pay tribute to who’ve absolutely pulled the stops out and made sure that we have the ventilator capacity that we needed when the number of people on ventilators was at its peak, which I think was about three weeks ago, [inaudible 00:01:20]? About that. So I pay tribute to the ventilator challenge and everybody who participated in it, they’ve done an amazing job, and they have, and so far it’s been successful in ensuring we’ve always got those ventilators that people need. Chris Lloyd from the Northern Echo."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Chris Lloyd: (40:41);Afternoon. Thanks for having me. What is the time lag of the pandemics progress? As the country went into lockdown at the same time, is it possible that the regions, like here in the northeast, were locked down comparatively early and so might not be hit as hard as was once feared? Although I note in your earlier slide there was a slight uptake in all regions outside of London of the number of people in hospital. And will that have any impact on a second wave in the regions? And how will the time lag inform policy on lifting the lockdown? Do you imagine that some areas might ease before others or will we all be in or out of lockdown together, and then, hopefully I’m not outstaying my welcome here. Looking further ahead, northern manufacturing towns bore the brunt of previous economic downturns, so how will the government ensure its measures to help the country recover are regionally applicable in terms of manufacturing, infrastructure, even moving government jobs out of London?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (41:37);Well Chris, you’re very welcome here at the press conference. I’m going to ask Angela to answer the substance of the first part of your question, but the first thing I’d say is I want to pay tribute to the people of the northeast for staying at home and helping to ensure that the number of cases in the northeast has relatively low. And knowing Newcastle well as I do, I know that the people of the Northeast are very gregarious and have done their duty by staying at home, which is what is needed in these circumstances. On the economic question that you rightly raise, absolutely it is a top priority to make sure that we level up this country and that agenda will be, I think even more important once we’re through coronavirus and recovering from it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (42:37);Northeast councils have been allocated more than 600 million pounds as part of the business support package, and we’ve identified more than 50,000 business properties which may be able to receive a grant in the Northeast. So we are putting the economic support in place during the crisis, but I’m absolutely sure that after the crisis, the top priority of the government will be to level up and make sure that all parts of this country can recover together because that is going to be a huge task. If I can ask Professor McLean to answer on the shape of the curve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (43:20);Your observation is absolutely right, that London was always high above the other regions of England and evolved administrations, and interestingly there is a signal in there that London turned over perhaps a little bit earlier than other regions, and various of our scientists around the country are combing through that data and other places where we might be able to see that signal to see if they can find anything to explain why that should be so. If there is an effect, it’s quite small actually. It’s not a huge, great big difference between the regions. You are right that yesterday’s numbers were a little bit higher in most regions and the day before, but it’s a tiny effect. It’s well within the noise that we see in these data sets. I watched these data incredibly carefully and whilst I would much rather they went down absolutely regularly every day, an increase like that is not something that worries me."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Angela McLean: (44:22);The question of whether or not we should have regional policies, I think it’s a really interesting one. It’s the kind of thing that you can imagine epidemiologists all over the world, not just in this country, are puzzling over. I think there’s always a trade off, isn’t there, between making sure you do things that are incredibly beautifully tailored to each part of your population. And on the other hand, keeping things simple and actually also carrying on all being in this together. So I don’t have an answer for you for that at the moment, but I can reassure you that all the time, one of the things we do is we look at the data altogether and we disaggregate it and look at it in regions."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (45:05);Thanks very much Chris. Have you got a follow up question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Chris Lloyd: (45:07);Yeah. I mean, I did ask about the time lag as well and whether different parts of the country might be ease from the lockdown at different times because of the time lag, or will we all be under the lockdown at the same time together?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (45:19);So that is a question that we’re looking at. There was a big benefit, I think, as we brought in the lockdown measures of the whole country moving together. We did think about moving with London and the Midlands first because they were more advanced in terms of the number of cases, but we decided that we are really in this together and the shape of the curve, if not the height of the curve, has been very similar across the whole country. It went up more in London, but it’s also come down more. But the broad shape has been similar, which is what you’d expect given that we’ve all been living through the same lockdown measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (46:02);The other thing to say is that it isn’t just about the level, it’s also about the slope of the curve, and if the R goes above one anywhere, then that would eventually lead to an exponential rise and a second peak and an overwhelming of the NHS in that area unless it’s addressed. So although the level of the number of cases is different in different parts, the slope of the curve has actually been remarkably similar across the country. So that argues for doing things as a whole country together. I hope that makes sense. Thanks very much for coming Chris. Appreciate it. Finally, Adam Vaughn from The New Scientist."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Adam Vaughn: (46:48);Hi, you said you were recruiting 18,000 contact tracers. I wanted to ask, how many do you have today, what date will you hit 18,000 and how important are those tracers as a strategy for controlling the virus after the lockdown? And secondly, we heard today that the NHS contact tracing out where will be ready within three weeks. What’s your goal for the number of people you want to download it and how will you incentivize them to do so?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (47:16);I knew we’d get some tough questions from The New Scientist. The answer to your questions are as soon as possible and as many as possible. But I know that’s not exactly a numerical answer. We’re recruiting the contact tracers. I’m sorry I don’t have the information to hand as to exactly how many we’ve recruited, but that is underway. We hope to have the contact tracers who will help when we find a positive test to work out who they’ve been in contact with and make sure they do the appropriate thing. We hope to have the contact tracers in place before or at the same as the app goes live and you’re right on the app."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (47:59);We’re expecting that to be ready by the middle of May and both of these things together, because they work together along with the testing and they’ll help us to keep the level of new cases down once we’ve used social distancing measures to get those new cases down. That’s the best thing for health and it’s the best thing for the economy. It’s a work in progress. I appreciate that, other than saying the middle of May, I haven’t given you numerical details. I don’t have the data to hand, but I’ll try to find that for you. And then on the how many people, the more people who download the app and keep their Bluetooth on, the more effective the app is going to be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (48:49);So there is no answer other than as many as possible because if everybody downloads it will just be more effective at spotting who people have been in contact with through contact tracing and helping alongside the human contact tracing for people to be able to keep the R down by catching those who they may have transmitted the disease to. It’s also of course tied with the rules around isolation because if you are … What really also matters is if you’ve been in substantial contact with somebody who’s tested positive, making sure we get the right rules around what that person is then required and asked to do is also a critical part of this, this infrastructure that we’re building."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Speaker 3: (49:43);Well, I’d just ask a follow up question. From what you’ve just said, you said that the human contact traces and the app will work in tandem, and you’re saying if the app is coming in three weeks, does that mean the target for the 18,000 is in three weeks?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-28","Matt Hancock: (49:56);Before or at the same time as the app. Yeah. Okay. Good stuff. Thank you very much indeed. Great to have The New Scientist at the Downing Street briefing and I hope my answer was scientifically valid. Thank you very much for joining us and no doubt see you again soon."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (00:02);Good afternoon and welcome to today’s Downing Street press conference. I’m pleased to be joined by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer, and also professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England. Let me just start by saying I think, on behalf of us all, a huge congratulations to the prime minister and to Carrie on the wonderful news of the birth of their baby boy. I have spoken to the PM and I can tell you that both mum and son are doing really well. Now, next, let me give an update on the latest data on coronavirus from our Cobra data file. And I can report that, through the government’s ongoing monitoring and testing program, as of today, there have now been 818,539 tests for the virus across the U.K., including 52,429 tests that took place yesterday. 165,221 people have tested positive. And that’s an increase of 4,076 cases on yesterday’s number."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (01:06);Now, as the health sector announced yesterday, from today, we’re moving to an improved daily reporting system for deaths so that that’s in all settings are included wherever the individual has tested positive for COVID-19, rather than just those in hospitals. And those figures show that, up to yesterday on the new measure, we have recorded an additional 3, 811 deaths in total. And I think it’s just important to say that those additional deaths were spread over the period from the 2nd of March to the 28th of April. So, they don’t represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (01:47);Sadly, today’s figures show an additional 765 deaths compared to yesterday. I’ll let professor Doyle talk us through the data in detail in a little while. But I think we must never lose sight of the fact that behind every statistic there are many human lives that have been tragically lost before their time. We also pay tribute, of course, to those caring for the sick. And yesterday at 11 o’clock in the morning, the whole country observed a minute silence, a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of all of our frontline workers who have died whilst dedicated themselves to caring for and serving others."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (02:28);Now, on the 16th of April, I set out five principles that would guide our approach to the transition away from the current set of social distancing measures in place and into a second phase. We continue to see evidence in the data of a flattening of the peak of the virus. And that is only happening because we delivered on the two central pillars of our strategic approach to defeating coronavirus. The first one was that we reinforced our NHS capacity through the Nightingale Hospitals, the extra critical care capacity, more ventilator beds, and extra doctors and nurses on the front line. And the second is that we introduced the social distancing measures at the right time, guided by the scientific and medical evidence. And the public’s overwhelming support for those rules has helped save lives and protect the NHS from becoming overwhelmed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (03:18);Now, we’re still coming through the peak. And this is, as I’ve said before, a delicate and dangerous moment in this crisis. So, I know that a lot of people have made a lot of sacrifices, which is why it’s so important that we don’t let up now and risk undoing all of that hard work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (03:38);So, as we look to the future, our five tests remain absolutely key. First, we must continue to boost NHS capacity, preventing it from being overwhelmed. Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the number of deaths. Thirdly, we need to see further reductions in the rate of infection to manageable levels across all the relevant areas and settings. And fourth, we must be confident the NHS will be able to cope with future demands. And that includes as a result of any changes to existing measures or new measures that we may need to take."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (04:17);Fifth, and I think this is probably the most critical of the five principles, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. A second spike will be harmful to public health. And it would result in many more deaths from COVID-19. That itself would lead to a second lockdown, inflicting further prolonged economic pain on the country. And, as the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said last week, that wouldn’t just be economically dangerous. It would inflict a serious blow to public confidence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (04:56);So, this issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it, it’s not a theoretical risk. And it’s not something that’s just confined to the United Kingdom. Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the last week, they’ve seen a rise in the transmission rate of Coronavirus. Chancellor Merkel has said publicly, and she’s made it clear that they might need a second lockdown in Germany if the infection rate continues to rise. So, this is a very real risk. And it’s vital we proceed carefully guided by the scientific advice so that our next step through this crisis is a sure footed one. We mustn’t gamble away the sacrifices and the progress that we’ve made. We must continue to follow the scientific evidence. And we must continue to take the right decisions at the right moment in time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (05:45);Now, we are working on all of the potential options for a second phase. There is light at the end of the tunnel, whether you’re an NHS worker on the frontline working tirelessly shift after shift, or a parent at home with young children. But we do need to be patient and we need to be careful as we come through what is a moment of maximum risk. So, we’ll wait for Sages next review of the data in early May. We’re ramping up the testing with capacity now at over 73,000 per day and 52,429 tests carried out per day. And eligibility for those tests is now being expanded again further to include anyone who needs to go to work and can’t work remotely and who has symptoms. It also includes anyone over 65 with symptoms and all care home residents, as well as care home staff. And, at the same time, as we ramp up the testing capacity, we’ll keep working on our tracking and tracing capability, which is going to be a key component in the next phase of this crisis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (06:52);We’ll continue to source ventilators and personal protective equipment both at home and abroad. Paul Dayton is leading the national effort to increase domestic production and supply. We continue to source PPE from abroad. We’re setting ourselves out as the international buyer of choice in the international marketplace. And I can tell you that, in the last ten days, we’ve secured over five million masks from China. We’ve had three flights with gowns from Turkey. Because we know that every single one of those items of PPE is needed by those working so hard on the front line, both in NHS and also in our care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (07:31);And our international effort isn’t confined to procurement. I can tell you we’ve also made enormous progress in returning British nationals who otherwise would have been at risk of being stranded abroad. And it’s worth just noting that, since the outbreak in Wu Han, we’ve helped an estimated 1.3 million British nationals return on commercial flights. And we’ve done that by working with the airlines and with those governments to make sure that the flights can run and that the airspace is left open. And we brought back over 200,000 British nationals from Spain, 50,000 from Australia, and over 11,000 from Pakistan, to name but just three countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (08:12);As well as those commercial flights, we’ve also chartered flights where commercial options were not possible. And we’ve now reached the stage where we’ve brought back over 20,000 British nationals on 21 flights. And that includes 9,000 British nationals who had been brought back from India, 2,000 from South Africa, and 1,200 from Peru."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (08:34);So, it’s also, just in terms of repatriations, worth bearing in mind that on the 17th of March when we changed our travel advice for those traveling on cruise ships, there were something like 19,000 British passengers on 60 cruise ships sailing around the world. And, as the border restrictions were put in place by country after country, we faced a daunting task in getting our people home. But we stuck at it. And six weeks later, we’ve now got all 19,000 British passengers back home, safe and sound."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (09:11);So, that was an enormous effort. And we recognize that the job isn’t yet done. We’ll continue with this unprecedented effort with further charter flights coming back from New Zealand, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, amongst others, over the next week or so. So, I must pay tribute, at this point, to all of the outstanding work our conciliar teams working night and day at the FCO in London, but also at our embassies and our high commissioners around the world have been putting in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (09:40);Finally, the Health Secretary announced last week that U.K. trials have started as we draw on the incredible scientific talent that we’ve got in this country to pursue a vaccine. And that effort too has an international dimension to it. So, today we announced that the U.K. will provide GAVI, which is the International Vaccine Alliance, with the equivalent of 330 million pounds each year over the next five years as we seek to come up with a vaccine, both to protect the British people, but also to help immunize millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people right around the world, combining the depth of our innovative knowhow with the big hearted determination that has characterized our national effort to defeat the Coronavirus. And having said that, I’m now going to ask Yvonne to talk us through the latest data slides. Yvonne, over to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (10:31);Thank you, Secretary of State. We have a selection of measures and slides here today to show. And the first one is just to remind us of the five tests for adjusting the lockdown. As the Secretary of State has said, this is about capacity, it’s about a fall in the daily deaths, it’s about reliable data, and also that we have good supplies of material for our NHS and care staff and that we’re confident that the adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (11:05);But moving to the actual slides, and the next slide, please, shows what is going on out in society at the moment. This is a transport slide which shows the use of various forms of transport. As we’ve seen up to now, very dramatic falls in most modes, but there has been an uptick in motor vehicles. And the message here really is that we are still passing through this peak. And this use of motor vehicles, it’s the highest working day use since the 23rd of March. And we really have to be vigilant that most people are making huge efforts to stay at home and save lives. And this is slightly worrying. So, please do stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives, and go out for the necessities. And the transport data will reflect that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (12:02);And the next slide, please, is about new cases in the NHS and in the country at the moment, in the UK. And we can see here the increasing amount of testing that’s going on through the orange bars. But basically, the cases have remained broadly stable over the last weeks. And that is good news. But I want to move on really to show you a little more about that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (12:27);The next slide, please, does show this. So, now we have a slide about people in hospital. And this is broadly good news because the numbers in hospital have decreased from over 18,000 to over 15,000. That’s a 16% decrease. And it’s manifest in all regions. You can see how London had an early peak. But now, London is declining in its use of hospital facilities. But, of course, other regions may overtake that. So, we do have to be careful. As I say, we are passing through this peak. We’re not through this yet. And the next slide, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (13:03);… To speak. We’re not through this yet. And the next slide, thank you is about critical care bed use in the UK and this means all beds, both high dependency and intensive care wards use, and this is good news because we can see here that 40% of the beds are being used. That means there is critical care capacity, and that is a credit to the NHS for how it has got us through this crisis to this stage, and there is capacity and room for patients who need it. The next slide please is about the cumulative daily COVID deaths. Now this is an interesting slide where we’ll begin to get into a little bit more into what is going on with deaths. So the deaths in hospital is the blue line, and that is what has been measured very reliably up to now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (13:52);But now public health England, with support from the NHS, has been in a position to congregate deaths in all settings based on confirmed tests that we see coming through our labs. So what we can see here is first of all that the deaths on the orange line are confirmed deaths from coronavirus, that tells us what exactly is going on in all settings. And when I say all settings, I mean hospitals, health protection team, the local outbreak teams in the community broadly and in care homes. So now we see that there is a divergence. It’s not a huge, it’s about a 20% divergence, but it’s good news in the main in terms of what it is showing because what it’s showing is we are getting a comprehensive picture and this is most important for control. So could I move on to the next slide please?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (14:46);Which is about the daily deaths, which is excluding deaths outside of hospital. So these are hospital deaths, which is what we were looking at in the previous slide in the blue side. It shows this declining trend of deaths in hospitals, which the trend started to increase at the end of March and we can see it declining. But to restress, we’re still coming through the peak because of course this doesn’t represent all deaths, but it is good news about deaths in hospital and that is also a credit to the good treatment in hospital. The next slide looks at COVID deaths in all settings and you can see there it’s a cumulative line there, the orange line. And it’s good to do it that way because otherwise you get swings and ups and downs when weekends occur and people are not sure what has happened with deaths."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (15:42);But with the line you can see the trend and the trend is quite flat actually. And it may begin to decline, but we’re not convinced of that yet. But it’s good to show that. And the reason it starts at the 30th of March is because this is about all settings. That was the time when we were able to start measuring that from then on. And so this is a seven day rolling average and it clearly … And it’s very important, we know what’s happening daily. Now on to global. So global death comparisons are two slides here. The first one is actually just crude numbers. And you can see here a portion that looks like the United States has a very high number of deaths and other countries perhaps are aligning with each other. But the point on this slide, the slide says a number of things."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (16:33);First of all, and these measures may not be comprehensive measures of death … And we’re very keen to do here and are doing now comprehensively. So for instance in Spain, we’re not absolutely clear whether the deaths in Spain include all care home deaths. And this is understandable because it’s very complex and difficult to get these measures, particularly on a daily basis, which is why the news today about being able to do this on a daily basis is very good news. Although of course the news about numbers of deaths is not good news and, again, stresses how dangerous this virus is, how sad it is for those individuals, and how we have to be ever vigilant about how we look after each other and how we adhere to the requests to stay at home, protect the NHS, and particularly to save lives. Now the last slide is also interesting because this now shows the cumulative death number per million population, and this shows a very different pattern where we can see two measures for the UK, the hospital deaths and the comprehensive deaths. They’re not hugely different on this scale, but you can see where we are now tracking much more along our European neighbors and also, and we’ve seen Italy and Spain there and France, but the US of course has dropped because we’re now measuring rates per a million. Other countries have increased. The important thing here is that it is … Our measures are comprehensive, they’re daily and they’re taken in all care settings. So I thought you would wish to see the two contrasts. Thank you [inaudible 00:18:22]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (18:22);Thank you very much indeed. I think we’ll now turn to questions from the media and I think first up we’ve got Hugh Pin from the BBC. Hugh, you there?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Hugh Pin: (18:34);Foreign secretary, question about testing. What support will you give care homes in administering and organizing tests and helping them keep residents and staff safe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (18:49);Well, I’m happy to let either Yvonne or Jonathan come in, but just to be clear, we’ve expanded the eligibility. Eligibility now includes anyone in a care home where they’re resident or staff and we have obviously had a distribution issue. There’s no sugarcoating the challenge we’ve had with that, we’ve helped deliver them through the local resilience forum. We are getting the clipper service up and running and the military have also done an exceptional job. So whether it’s the supply, and which we’re ramping up in the way I described and the health secretary has explained, or the delivery, are we doing everything that we possibly can? Yvonne, I don’t know whether you or Jonathan want to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (19:33);Well and thanks. Yes indeed Hugh. So there are a number of ways that testing is and will continue to happen at scale in care homes since this epidemic in care homes, which still continues and there has been a huge local effort both through local government, our directors of public health, our health protection teams, but increasingly with support from national endeavors to get the tests to the home to make sure staff get the testing they need. This will continue for some considerable time until we are convinced that we have got under this epidemic in the care homes, which is of course utmost concern."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (20:11);Anything else you’d like to ask on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Hugh Pin: (20:14);Couldn’t testing really have started sooner than that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (20:18);Well, Hugh, testing has always occurred during outbreaks and that has never been given up at a local level. Our health protection team supported by others, the NHS locally, have been into and going into care homes throughout the country. But the scale and the speed of this epidemic is really in the last couple of weeks, and there is a huge national and local endeavor to both not just test, which is very important, but to also understand the measures that would make a difference in care homes. And to look at that in a very rapid way looking at the evidence so that we can put in place measures that protect people. People are absolutely passionate about getting this right, but it is the most complex sector to get to 16,000 homes, a lot of places to go under … Critical to use local intelligence as to where the risks are highest."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (21:11);Also Hugh it’s just worth saying that of course you’d have to have an enormous testing capacity to deliver what I think you’re suggesting we could have or should have. One of the big challenges we’ve had is asymptomatic people coming to and in and out of care homes, whether it’s other care home workers who work in more than one place and it just staff coming in or indeed members of a family and there’s an onset, it’s obviously a very decentralized system, but the social distancing and the control over transmission in and out of care homes, it’s probably the single biggest factor and obviously we’re doing everything we can to give the guidance and give the support to care homes to achieve that. Dan Hughet, ITV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Hughet: (21:55);Thank you secretary of state. And we’ve discovered that hospices are being denied access to government managed supplies of PPE, of personal protective equipment. Unlike hospitals and care homes, they are not being included in the main NHS supply chain managed by the government through supply chain coordination limited. Instead, hospice are still relying on donations of PPE and they’re having to buy their own largely on the open market at hugely inflated prices. It means the hospices have told us that they could run out of PPE within a matter of days. Why is it the hospices are being treated differently to hospitals and care homes when it comes to accessing PPA?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (22:32);Well, again, I’ll defer to Jonathan and Yvonne, but basically, and I don’t know of course the hospices that you’ve talked to, but we’ve been guided throughout by the NHS about, A, where the shortfalls have been and, B, what’s the priority? And we’ve always said that the priority is being on the frontline and the NHS and care homes. But obviously we want to make sure we’ve got enough PPE. That’s why we’re doing all of these flights from abroad, that’s why Paul Dayton’s ramping up the domestic capacity to get to anyone that may need it. And obviously hospice is a very important area as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (23:09);Yeah, secretary of state. It’s very important we ascertain where these problems are and that’s why local intelligence is very important. The guidance covers all places where people are at risk. So that’s very important to say. There is no differentiation here in where people are at risk and what they might need. What may often be lacking is the knowledge of where there are pockets of problems, and we’ve had this throughout. So it is welcome to know this and there are ways in which hospices can actually make known what they need through helplines. But if that isn’t happening then it’s very important that we do hear this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (23:45);Thank you. Do you want to supplement anything you want to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Hughet: (23:49);Yeah. Thank you so secretary of state. On that, Hospice UK, the main charity, I understand they’ve been coordinating and speaking to the relevant bodies within government to explain and have provided evidence that shows they need this PPE. So you’re absolutely right to say must go where it needs to, but they have made a very strong case to say they need it. They’re treating three times as many terminally ill patients now than they were this time last year. They’re treating people with coronavirus, so they definitely do need this PPE. I think the assurance they want is when they’ll be included in the NHS supply chain because they say they are caring for very second vulnerable people as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (24:26);Oh absolutely. And my heart goes out to all of those working in hospices, those that have been cared for and their family and we’ll do everything we can in the way Yvonne described to make sure that we get PPPE to them as soon as we physically can. Beth Rippe from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Beth Rippe: (24:44);Thank you. First, secretary of state, on Sunday you said you were, and I quote you, reasonably confident that deaths in care homes are coming down at about the same rate more broadly as captured by the NHS figures. What does this new data tell you? Are we actually approaching a peak in care homes, if not overall? And Professor Van Tom, extra deaths today show the situation even worse than we knew. But it’s true too that these numbers could be underreported still in part because of low testing levels. Should we be braced for a farther upward revision of these figures in the future?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (25:25);So Beth, look. In the way that Yvonne described the importance of getting these measures refined is that we’ve got a clearer picture and of course what we’d like is a perfect picture and we’re constantly looking to see whether we can modify and glean a more granular picture. The reality is, and I think when Sage gave its evidence on its review of the social distancing measures around the 16th of April, I think it was the press conference, so it was shortly before then. They were very clear that the R level was coming down. It was below one in the community, but there were challenges in hospital settings. We’re getting to grips with that, but also in-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (26:03);There were challenges in hospital settings. We’re getting to grips with that, but also in care homes. So we’ve known about this challenge, and we’re doing everything we can to meet it. PPE is one of the aspects of it, testing is another, but probably the single biggest thing, and this is tough in a decentralized, localized set of care homes, is making sure that we control the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that may risk transmitting the virus. So alongside all of those other practical measures, disseminating that guidance, refining that guidance, supporting those care homes as best we can is the surest way that we will really get a grip and then drive down those infection levels in the care home scenario. Yvonne, is there anything you’d like to add, or Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (26:47);I might just add, but Jonathan can supplement this. So Beth, the question is opposite to what CQC also measures. So CQC will also put out deaths in care homes, and they will not always be confirmed by testing. So in due course, those deaths sadly may occur on death certificates. So we may expect more than we’re seeing at the moment. Yes. Sorry, Jonathan, that was just my [crosstalk 00:27:18]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (27:17);And it’s worth just bearing in mind, as Yvonne said earlier in relation to the slides, what we’re trying to do is get the most granular picture. I think when it comes to the international comparisons, certainly not all of the countries are recording even to the level that we’ve got to now, which is why some of those international comparisons, but we’re just committed to maximum transparency. One because people should know the full picture and secondly, when you know more about the data, you’ve got a better chance of gripping it in the way that we’re absolutely committed to doing. Jonathan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (27:45);Yes. So thank you, Beth. I’ll answer your question in a slightly different way and say that clearly we have moved to a system of recording deaths that is better and more granular because it covers more than just the hospital setting, but in epidemiology terms, eventually we will be able to compute a different estimate of deaths called excess deaths and that is really accepting that across the year deaths go up in the winter and down in the summer in a broadly oscillating wave and one can work out what the average is over multiple years and then work out what in this particular coronavirus pandemic our departure has been from that in terms of total number of deaths. And that will give us an excess death figure and that will be highly comparable when other excess death figures come out across the world, including many parts of Europe."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (28:46);In fact, there’s a standardized methodology that the Europeans use for calculating excess mortality. So to your point, will there be more? I think I’d kind of turn that question slightly or turn the answer and say in time we’ll have a much better answer when we start to look at excess mortality as a total, which will take into account both deaths related to COVID-19 and deaths that may have occurred, not due to COVID-19 at all, but as a consequence of the crisis. And some of those will take time to come through and I’m afraid that is a phenomenon that we will face right across the world with this awful crisis that we’re in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (29:34);Beth, do you want to pick up on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Beth: (29:36);Yeah, just quickly. Just to follow up, it’s been really encouraging that although the death toll has been horrific, but it has been falling in hospitals. Now you have the care home data, is it falling in hospitals, but that death tally going up still in care homes?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (29:52);I’m not sure we have the data, but I’ll-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (29:54);I don’t think we can say that quite yet, Beth. I wouldn’t make any predictions about what will happen in care homes, but we should know that soon because the hospital curve has declined. Bearing in mind that still the majority of deaths do occur in hospital, including those who are resident in care homes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (30:17);Beth, thanks very much. Andy Bell from Channel 5."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (30:21);Thanks very much. You have your five tests that you say have to be met before we can move on in terms of lockdown. Right now, how many of those tests do you think you’re passing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (30:35);Well, as I said, when I set them out, we will need the advice from SAGE, which was going to be three weeks after, I think the 16th of April, so it will come early May. So we don’t know yet. There is some positive signs in the data, but as Yvonne has said and as we’ve been at pains to say we’re at a delicate and dangerous moment in this challenge. We’re coming through the peak, but we’re not there yet, which is why keeping on focusing on the social distancing measures, which has been one of the great successes of the approach taken because of the support of the British people is so important. So people sitting at home watching this have saved lives by following that guidance. And until we’re out of the woods, if I can put it like that, they need to keep doing that. And we won’t know that we’ve reached that point until SAGE give us that review of the evidence."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (31:24);I can I come back in on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (31:24);Sure, of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Andy Bell: (31:26);But the government has said several times that the NHS is not being overwhelmed, is not being overtopped. Are you saying you’re not even satisfied at this stage that you can say you’ve passed test number one?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (31:37);Well, then it just quite clearly hasn’t been overwhelmed. That’s been the second key critical bit of the strategy which we delivered successfully. It’s a great credit to those in the front line, but we have also got the ventilator beds, the critical care capacity up, the military have done a great job in supporting the new Nightingale hospitals. So we’re confident at this stage, but of course if you look at the five tests, Andy, and I know you’re taking this very seriously, we’ve also said that we need to make sure that we can see to the future that that will still be the case, and also with any changes we might make and what that would do, not just to the coronavirus infection rate as we’ve seen in Germany, but also to the non-COVID cases. We need to be confident the NHS will be able to cope. So you’re right, absolutely to point to the five tests, and I’ve just got to say at this moment in time, we’re waiting for SAGE’s evidence on all five aspects, which we’re expecting in early May."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (32:35);Can I bring in Jason Groves from the Daily Mail?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (32:40);Thanks. Foreign Secretary, you may have seen overnight the new mail force charity has brought in a million pounds with the PPE from China. You know how difficult that is. You’ve got your own challenges with PPE. I wondered how helpful that sort of private sector initiative is and to Professor Van-Tam, we’ve heard a little bit about this idea that the virus perhaps fades more slowly outdoors than it does indoors. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about that and what the implications of that might be."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (33:13);Well, Jason, fantastic mail force campaign, a hundred thousand miles, 50,000 overalls, all going to those frontline workers in the NHS in care homes. I’ve just got to pay tribute, the Daily Mail has really contributed to that national effort that we were talking about and it all counts. So a huge thanks, I think from the government side."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:37);Jonathan. Okay, so thank you for the question about how the virus spreads and to what extent it spreads and if I can just replay the question back to you to be sure I heard it right. You were asking about the difference between indoors and outdoors?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (33:54);Yeah, that’s right."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (33:56);Thank you. Okay, so we have learned a great deal over the years from studying influenza and patterns of transmission of influenza, and I accept that the coronavirus is a new virus, it is not entirely the same as influenza and we are getting more and more data on transmission of COVID-19 as the days and weeks roll by. But nevertheless there is a definite truism across all of the science literature that ventilation is the most critical part of reducing transmission from respiratory viruses. And if you think about being outdoors, first of all, by and large distancing between human beings is greater anyway, but if you just stand still for a moment and experience just normal breezes and air currents around you, you absolutely get a sense that any kind of plumes of anything are going to be very rapidly dispersed. And from that perspective it is absolutely categorically clear that outdoor spaces with higher degrees of ventilation are less problematic environments for transmission than indoor spaces."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:17);And of course you only have to go as far as thinking about flu and summer, winter and the way we live our lives. In the winter, we live indoors, in conditions of relatively low ventilation with the windows closed. In the summer, we go outdoors, we leave the doors and the windows open when we’re at home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (35:38);Jason, do you want to come back on any of that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jason Groves: (35:39);Yeah. Well, thanks for your comments and I was going to come back on that latter point. People are obviously thinking about what’s going to happen in this next phase. Given that difference, might it mean that there is some hope for things like garden centers, outdoor events, like park runs, going to the beach, maybe even beer gardens before people sort of give up hope?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:04);Thank you for the question and I completely get it and understand why you’re asking the question. SAGE absolutely is keeping all of that evidence under very considerably detailed review and that evidence has been formulated into guidance that we are putting forwards to ministers on a periodic basis."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:28);Now in terms of any of the settings that you mentioned, I just want to take us through the journey a little and say that these are complex and at various different points they might involve the congregation of individuals and one has to be very painstaking and very careful about thinking through some of these before we make the wrong move to relax measures. And so from that perspective, I think all of your comments are valid, but I think we have to be extremely surefooted and extremely painstaking about this."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:12);This virus will absolutely come back. You’ve seen Secretary of State refer to the resurgence in Germany and the difficult considerations that are going on there. This is with us for quite some time, potentially for as long as until we get a vaccine. So from that perspective we have to be really careful and really surefooted, and I’m just not going to suggest for a moment that any of this should be rushed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (37:40);Thanks, Jason. Dan Bloom from the Daily Mirror."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Bloom: (37:43);Hello. I’d like to ask if we had been able to access better testing and screening earlier than we did for care home residents. So for example, were testing those discharged from hospital before mid-April and some of the other things the government has introduced, might some of the deaths that have been published today been avoided?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (38:03);I think there’s always learning in a unprecedented unique crisis like this that we’ll want to feed back in to make sure that we can refine and fine tune the measures we’re taking. You’ll know, Dan, we take the actions and the steps that we take on the best scientific evidence we’ve got at the time. I think in relation to care homes, and as I mentioned before, the key thing above all is to manage the transmission, of the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that might carry the virus. And that of course includes family members and friends, it includes people that are working in more than one care home setting, it includes NHS staff. So on top of testing and BP and all the things I understand you want to raise, I think that’s probably the single most important aspect. Do you want to come back on anything else there, Dan?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dan Bloom: (38:53);I’d quite like to ask the medical experts, what they think of the same question because they may have an opinion on it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (39:00);Of course. Yvonne."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne Doyle: (39:02);Yeah. Thank you, Dan-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (39:02);Of course. Yvonne?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (39:02);Yeah. Thank you Dan. So it’s a very good question and it’s also a learning one, but I put it this way, where there have been outbreaks in care homes, there has always been intervention throughout this. That would be no different to normal practice. What we have learned a lot about is how the virus is behaving in different populations. And one of the various other things that we have found is that the virus, when older people get this virus, it is affecting predominantly older people, particularly people over 75, and one of the reasons that the deaths are high there is that actually their demise quite quickly if they get the dose of this virus that perhaps a younger person might be able to put over their shoulder because of the way their immune system works. So that’s one feature. So it may not even be possible to have got to the test by the time the event happens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (39:54);Second, we’ve now learned from looking at the literature that we’ve asked and asked what is it that would make a difference to stop this epidemic in a home? And the movement of staff is an absolutely critical one and how the virus actually moves within a home. And that has really only begun to become evident since we’ve been able to look at new techniques like genomics. And that has given us a huge insight into the dynamics of what is happening within a home. And not every home will be the same in the way that people, residents and the staff interact, the use of bank staff. But there are some very interesting learning that we’ve come across quite recently. Now whether testing makes would have made a huge difference or not, it’s impossible to see at the moment. And that’s one thing we wanted learn but there has been testing but I think there are possibly more fundamental and structural issues about how care homes are run in an epidemic that we are now looking to implement."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (40:56);Thanks Dan. Matt Foster from Politics Home."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Matt Foster: (41:00);Hi for secretary of state. Your colleagues have spoken about us all being in this together, but there are a sizable number of people in the UK who despite paying taxes are barred from claiming universal credit, housing benefit, or free school meals for their kids because the home office has deemed that they have no recourse to public funds. Some of those people are working in key frontline jobs right now in the NHS, social care, and its delivery drivers. Will the government consider at least temporarily causing an RPS status during the outbreak and if not, what reassurance can you give people that they’re not going to be shut out the same help we all may need to rely on during an economic crisis?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (41:41);Look, I absolutely understand the point and obviously we feel for anyone who’s going through the challenges, whether professionally or in their home. I know the home secretary has been looking at this very carefully, she keeps these issues under constant review. I think she went before the home affairs committee today and said that we’ll always at new measures and what more can be done, particularly in relation, I think, to frontline workers from overseas who are working within care homes or the NHS, so I can’t give a commitment, but I can tell you that the home secretary is very carefully looking at that and the government wants to make sure we’re as sensitive and as flexible in our approach as we possibly can be. Do you want to come back with another one there, Matt?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Matt Foster: (42:24);That’s fine. Thanks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (42:24);Very good. And then finally Peter Madly from The Express and Star."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (42:31);Thank you, secretary of state. A question for the medical experts schools across the Westman and just starting to consider how things might look once they’re up and running again. The education secretary said today that schools will reopen in phases and clearly some form of social distancing will be required. Can you give us an idea of how you think social distancing will work in a school setting and do you envisage home education continuing for some pupils into next year?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (42:58);Secondly, a question for you, secretary of state. You mentioned repatriation flights before. There’s still thousands of British citizens stranded in India, particularly in the Punjab region, a lot from West Midlands and that area of the country in fact. The CTM charter team has said this week that more than 20,000 people have registered for flights from an Amritsar in the North, there’s only one flight every couple of days with a maximum capacity of 300 so people who are running out of money and medicine have been told it’s not possible to confirm when they’ll be able to get back. Now, do you have an idea of how many Brits are stuck in India, and are you planning to increase the number of repatriation flights from Northern cities so these people can return home?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (43:41);Well, thanks very much. And look, can I first of all say the incredible effort from the West Midlands where you’re reporting both the NHS care homes and frankly the people following the social distancing guidance, it’s made a massive difference. We follow the regional impact of all the measures that we’re putting in place and NHS capacity. And I know the West Midlands are putting an incredible shift. On repatriation flights, and just to give you a sense, we’ve already charted, so separate from the commercial flights, 58 returning more than 12,000 people from across South Asia."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (44:14);I can tell you that in recent days we’ve announced 28 more charter flights with the capacity to get around 77,000 more Brits back home. They’ll return home, that scheduling would be up until about May the seventh, they include 14 flights from India another nine from Pakistan, and five from Bangladesh. So we’re doing everything we can to get stranded Brits from the West Midlands and right across the country home. And as I’ve said in my earlier remarks, I think the foreign office and the department of transport and our missions abroad put in a heroic shift. But look, the jobs not yet done and as long as there are people that are in a predicament, we want to see what more we can do. I don’t know whether Jonathan or Yvonne wants to come back?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (45:01);Schools?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (45:02);Schools. Yes, please Jonathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (45:04);So I’ve got two sons, Alex and Theo at home, 11 and 12, and I know exactly how difficult it is for them wanting to go to school and the stress and strain that this is placing on people. But I’m absolutely clear that it was the right thing to do to close schools when we did and equally we now have to be very careful indeed about how we relax social distancing measures and when we do it and clearly there are multiple combinations of how one might think about that. I’m not going to go into those in detail because the scientific thinking is not yet complete or settled on those. It is still a matter of detailed daily and deliberation and study, and clearly as part of that relaxing schools is in the mix. Precisely how one would do that, I’m not going to comment further because I think there are multiple permutations that you can think of and we have to work through those carefully, one by one scientifically and get the best and the most optimized answer we can. So I wouldn’t want to make any premature comments about exactly how and to what extent schools are going to being involved in how we relax social distancing carefully, painstakingly and as and when we can with safety."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (46:34);Peter, is there anything else you’d like to come back on?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Peter Madly: (46:37);Yes, Mr. Van Tam. If I can be a bit more direct with my question in that case, do you think it’s possible for groups of young people to stay two meters apart all day long in a school?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Jonathon: (46:48);I think that will be very difficult with a classroom of four year olds, five year olds. I think that will be really tricky. I think we have to think through all of those measures and how that might work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (47:00);Thanks very much Peter. I think we’ve now got a couple of questions from members of the public. We’ve got Matthew from Surrey who’s asking what has been done to ensure that visitors or returning citizens coming through British ports and airports are going into a 14 day quarantine and why hasn’t this been implemented before? I’ll turn to Yvonne to answer this, but we’ve looked at this regularly. I’ve asked this question actually quite a few times, and so far the advice has come back that actually it wouldn’t make any significant material difference to stopping the spread. It may become more relevant as we progress through this crisis and as we bear down on the transmission rates within the UK. But Yvonne, I don’t know if there’s anything you’d add."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (47:50);Secretary of state, not very much. So Matthew, thank you. It’s a really interesting question and obviously as we move into a new phase over the coming months, it’s one that will come back again and the scientific advisory committee is looking at all of the measures that ports could and should perhaps do implement that would make a difference. That’s the important thing because otherwise we’re just disrupting everything for no particular gain and we have had some experience of it of course during the contained fees when we worked intensively with all the ports in Britain to ensure that we kept our citizens as safe as possible. And we’ve learned quite a bit from that. But there are a number of measures of which quarantine is one and it is being looked at."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (48:33);And of course as we keep the ports and the airports open for vital supply chains, that’s a consideration as well, but we’ll continue to keep that under review. I think there’s a second question which is coming up on the screen."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Bob: (48:51);As there has been success so far in not overwhelming the NHS and there seems to be plenty of space in the Nightingale Hospitals, why can’t we remove some residents from care homes for their immediate safety? If this takes place immediately and perhaps with military assistance, this could save some lives. Is it feasible in any way?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (49:14);Well, I’ll let Yvonne talk to the current situation. What I can say, it’s something that has been under constant discussion. Of course we want to make sure, and the Nightingale’s have been amazing and the military’s done a great job in supporting the NHS teams. We’ve got to make sure we’ve got the NHS capacities as we set out in our five principles for how we might move forward to the next phase that it’s not just there to deal with the current cases, but to deal with the future demands that may be put on the NHS, both in relation to the virus but also other health needs. But we’re looking at that, not least in the context of some of the cohorting that may need to be done, which hasn’t been done in some areas, some areas it has. So it’s certainly something that, again, remains under review. Yvonne, do you want to say a bit more on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Yvonne: (50:00);Thank you secretary of state and thank you Bob. So it is, and the Nightingale Hospitals, they operate on a number of different models and we’re looking at the difference between those models and whether they are adaptable to circumstances that may arise as we go forward, of which this would be one. And the issue about the home residence is that this has to be a humane solution for people and that it isn’t more damaging or harmful to have people move, particularly people who are already frail, vulnerable, maybe suffer from dementia. So it has to be looked at as a judgment in terms of what is the best thing to do for those people and what is the most humane intervention given the risk they may face. But it is certainly … It is something that is looked at and will be continued."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-april-29","Dominic Raab: (50:46);It’s worth also just saying, Bob, that one of the pieces of learning that the cabinet office had from 2016, we looked at the lessons learned from the flu epidemic we had was that the shift of people out of the NHS and into the community, including care homes, was something that was important, which should be taken forward. But I understand your question. We’ve got to make sure all of these things are done safely, and that doesn’t mean that certain NHS facilities couldn’t be used in the way that you’ve described. So we’re looking at all of that. Thank you very much, Bob. Thanks everyone for all of your questions. And that brings to a close today’s Downing Street press conference. Thank you very much. (silence)."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","British officials gave a coronavirus briefing on May 1. Matt Hancock led the briefing and said the UK has delivered on its target to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests per day."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Follow Rev Transcripts"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (00:12);Good afternoon and welcome once again to the Downing Street Daily Coronavirus Briefing. I’m joined by Professor John Newton who coordinates our work on testing and by Professor Steve Powis, who’s the medical director of the NHS."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (00:27);Every day we’re working through our plan to protect life and protect NHS by slowing the spread and building the capacity so at all times the NHS has got the capacity to give the very best care to everybody who needs it. In today’s briefing after setting out the daily statistics, I want to talk about testing. But beforehand, I’d like to share some really good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (00:58);Earlier this week I said that we are now able to begin the restoration of NHS services. Now, we’re past the peak, I can tell you about the next step, the restoration of fertility services. Few families have been untouched by the amazing advances in fertility treatments over past generation. And I know just how time sensitive fertility treatment can be and how important it is for the families affected, and I know that this treatment can change lives for better forever. When I say thank you to all of you, everybody watching, for staying at home to protect NHS, of course, I’m saying thank you on behalf of the lives that you’re saving, but I’m also saying thanks on behalf of the lives that the NHS can now once again help to create. Because together we’ve protected NHS, and we’re now restoring the NHS and restoring the chance for so many couples to start a family."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (02:15);Turning to the figures. 177,454 people have tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 6,201 since yesterday. 15,111 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus and 27,510 people have now sadly died across all settings, an increase of 739. As one, we will remember them and treasure their memories. This is a virus that has a devastating impact on families, on friends, on local communities. Right across government, we’re working day and night to defeat it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (03:04);At the beginning of last month, at this podium, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test and that as a nation we should achieve 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month. I knew that it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important for getting Britain back on her feet. I can announce that we have met our goal. The number of tests yesterday on the last day of April were 122,347. This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement, but it is not my achievement."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (03:57);It is a national achievement achieved by a huge team of people working together. And I tell you this, the testing capacity that we’ve built together will help every single person in this country. Testing is crucial to suppress the virus. I know from personal experience too, just how much people with symptoms want to know if they’ve got the disease. I know that I did. It helps remove the worry, it helps keep people safe and it will help us to unlock the lockdown. So many people have tragically died and the challenge we still face is vast, but we’re making real progress."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (04:43);I want to take a moment to thank and pay tribute to the incredible team who did this together and who joined in one of the greatest national mobilizations that we’ve seen. We brought together the best civil servants, the best minds from the private sector, the best scientists, the best lab technicians and the best of the best in the armed forces. Setting, stretching ambitious goals in a crisis has a galvanizing effect on everybody involved. It is a mission. If we hadn’t been so bold, if we’d chosen a safer, easier path, I just can’t see how we would have built the capacity that we need."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (05:23);In a few short weeks, we’ve created a new test for the virus in PHE, we’ve built a network of regional testing centers, we’ve put a fleet of mobile testing units on the road, and created home testing kits so if you can’t get to the test, we can get the test to you. We’ve more than doubled the capacity of NHS Public Health England labs and created three brand new mega labs to analyze the results."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (05:52);So many people have played a part in this work: British diagnostic companies like Randox and Oxford Nanopore and Medical Wire and DNANudge, and Samba, logistic companies like the Royal Mail and Yodel who were brilliant and got us out of a real hole this week: academics like Professor Derek Crook and Sir John Bell from Oxford and Professor Ara Darzi from Imperial, Deloitte and Boots, who’ve delivered our drive through centers, AstraZeneca, GSK and Novacyte whose labs go on stream next week, Public Health England and the NHS, of course, who pulled out all stops, Professor Sharon Peacock, Professor John Newton and the UK Biocentre and the Crick, who sets up high tech laboratories. And also it wasn’t just a national effort, but from across the world, including ThermoFisher, Hologic, Abbott and Amazon from the US, Qiagen from Germany and Roche from Switzerland."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (06:50);And this is how we did it. Because everybody worked together with grit and determination to reach a shared goal, and they thrived because the team contained diversity of perspectives, of background and, critically, a diversity of thought. And when things went wrong, which they did every single day, believe me, we didn’t ask who we could blame, we asked how we could fit it."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (07:19);So to my team. I want to say you toiled tirelessly night and day and I’m so proud of what you have achieved. And to all of you, on behalf of government, on behalf of the whole country, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (07:33);As prime minister said, a big increasing testing provides a way to unlock the puzzle of coronavirus. And testing forms the first element of our plan to test, track and trace. By mid-May, we’ll have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place. That work is underway as we speak. And if it needs to be bigger, we’ll scale it as required."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (07:57);The combination of contact tracers and new technology through our new COVID-19 NHS app will help tell us where the virus is spread and help everyone to control new infections. People will be able to know if they’ve been in close contact with someone who’s transmitting the disease and take the action that they need to."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (08:20);Our full-scale test, track and trace model will drive infection rate down, and the lower they are and the lower number of new infections, the more effective the country’s system will be. Tracing and tracing will allow us to get R down and hold R down, and so it will allow us to lift lockdown measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (08:45);Now this disease affects us all indiscriminately. We’ve seen that. In recent weeks, we’ve had to impinge on historic liberties to protect our NHS and our loved ones, and yet our goal must be freedom. Freedom from the virus, yes, and we will not lift measures until it is safe to do so. But also, we care about the restoration of social freedom and economic freedom too, each citizen’s right to do as they please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (09:18);For now, we’re working together to stay home. We’re impinging on the freedom of all, for the safety of all. With this next mission of test, track and trace. I’m seeking a solution that allows us, by each of us participating, to target the measures that are needed with much more precision, and so to reassert as much as is safely possible the liberty of us all. That is our next mission."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (09:50);But for now the most important thing for everyone to do to keep R down and to get us all through this, is to maintain the spirit and the resolve that’s had such an impact thus far. So please, stay at home. Protect the NHS and save lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (10:08);And now Professor Newton is going to set out some more details on testing and then I’m going to ask Professor Powis to set out and take us through the slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (10:20);Thank you very much, Secretary of State. And kind of also thank you on behalf of the program for those kind of thanks. It’s been a truly extraordinary collaboration, but thank you very much. We have reached an important milestone, but I want to explain why we need all this testing. Back in March, the country moved into lockdown because the virus was circulating widely, not because we did not have enough tests. Cases were popping up with no obvious connection to other cases and the infection was entering the exponential growth phase. And at that point, access to limitless testing, even if we had had it, would have made no difference. The decision went of going into lockdown would have been the same and would have been taken at the same time. In the same way the risk out of lockdown has not being blocked by low levels of testing, we can relax social distancing only when the government’s five tests are met, and that means particularly getting the infection rate right down. Testing will, as [inaudible 00:11:16] just mentioned, help to keep it under control once we’re out of lockdown, but our levels of testing have not kept us in lockdown down a day longer."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (11:25);What about Germany? People talk about Germany a lot. But yes, Germany had a lot of tests available from the get go, but there was also a lot less virus around in Germany when they introduced social distancing and it was circulating in younger people. As CMO pointed out in an earlier briefing, we should not rush to the conclusions about relationships between numbers of tests available and the outcomes in different countries. Nevertheless, as CMO also said, we are all learning from other countries and we have learned from the experience of other countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (11:55);But back to the here and now, where’s all this leave us in the UK? Well, the 100,000 tests a day target set for two purposes. As Secretary of State has mentioned it was intended to motivate the program and set the scale of our ambition, and it has certainly done that. More importantly though perhaps, we knew from our calculations that we would need something like this level testing to be ready for the next phase of the response to the pandemic."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (12:21);Looking to the future then, we now have a very substantial and flexible testing capability in the UK. It will be used to drive extensive contract tracing, control any new infections, to help us keep patients and staff safe in hospitals and care services and tell us with some precision how the virus has spread across the country and is spreading in the future. If we can quickly identify who may have been in contact with someone infected, we can prevent them from passing it on and though drive down transmission rates of the virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (12:57);Now the NHS app for contact tracing is also in development and making rapid progress. The more people who sign up for the new app when it goes live, the better informed our responses will be and the more effective we will be in keeping the virus under control."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor John Newton: (13:13);All this progress with testing and with our design of the next phase of contact tracing and the app, frees ministers and their scientific advisors to choose whatever future strategies are best suited to keep the country safe. I can assure you that the test capability we have built in the last few weeks is world-leading in its scale and sophistication, and gives us the flexibility we need. As the pandemic evolves, we will have the testing capacity to meet changing demand across the country. It is now there to serve us all. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (13:50);Thanks very much, John. And Professor Powis, if you’ll take us through the slides."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (13:55);Thank you very much, Secretary of State, and good afternoon everybody. So as I and others have said on many occasions, the magnificent response of British public-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (14:03);… many occasions, the magnificent response of British public to the government’s request to comply with social distancing instructions, has meant that we have begun to get on top of this virus. We’ve seen the transmission rate, reproduction rate, fall to below one, and that means that the number of infections is falling within our communities and that means the pressure has been kept off the NHS. The NHS has responded magnificently to make sure that our patients have always had available the treatment they require. And over time, this also has impact on the unfortunate number of deaths that we’ve seen. As we move to the next phase of managing COVID-19, I think the first thing I’d like to do is to remind everybody of the five tests that the government has set for adjusting the current lockdown."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (14:53);The first, I’ve already referred to and that’s the NHS continues to have sufficient capacity to provide the critical care requirements that are needed but also specialist treatment right across the U.K."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:06);Secondly, it’s that sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus and we are beginning to see that, but we need to make sure that that is maintained."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:18);Thirdly, it’s reliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. And again, as I’ve said, it’s everybody’s efforts in complying with social distancing that means that infections have fallen and will continue to fall."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:34);Fourthly, this has been a challenge, not just in the U.K. But globally around the operational response to a pandemic that includes PPE. It includes other things. And moving forward we to ensure that those challenges… Testing is one of them… are in hand and we are in a good position going forward to meet future demand."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (15:58);And finally and critically that any adjustments going forward, don’t risk a second wave or second peak of infections, that again runs a risk of overwhelming our health systems."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (16:12);So those are five key tasks that have been set and the government will be looking to confidence that it has met those before it moves to the next phase of the lockdown and the measures that we will need to take going forward to stay on top of this virus and ensure infection rates remain low."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (16:34);Now in the next slide we will provide, I’m providing some details of exactly how the public have complied. And the first is an example on how people have been approaching contact, particularly with vulnerable people over a period in middle part of April showing that 84%, the great majority of adults have said they either not left their home or only left the home from permitted reasons and 87% of adults avoiding contact with older or vulnerable people. So a great testament to the efforts that our British public have gone to, to ensure that we reduce infections. And on the right of this slide, some information on the number of people who’ve been working at home since social distancing issues were introduced and that’s 45% of adults in employment are saying that they work at home and compares to around 12% of last year. So again, a great increase in those that are not going up, that are staying at home and managing to work without having to go in their usual place of work."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (17:42);And on the third slide, begin to see the testing information the Secretary of State said as both Secretary St. John have said, the number of tests increased dramatically, but it’s not just the fact the numbers have increased. It’s the fact that capacity is increased so that we can use testing for a far wider range of purposes and you have already heard some of the areas in which that is going to critical going forward in the months ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (18:11);In the fourth slide, we show new cases as determined by positive tests. You will see that that has increased a bit in recent days, but that should see it in the context of increased the number of tests in the round. So more testing and more testing of different groups of individuals is likely to bring more positive tests as a result. But overall I think the number relatively stable and that is a good sign and reflects that the level of infection is falling."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (18:44);The next slide then moved to people who unfortunately, and again it’s a mild illness for the majority of people, but for a proportion who do have to be admitted to hospital, you can see that since the middle of April, numbers of people in hospital with COVID- 19 have been falling and that’s particular marked in London. That was ahead in terms of the infection rate and therefore that all has come quickest in London. It is starting to move down maybe at a slower level in other regions of the U.K. But nevertheless overall the trend is downwards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (19:22);And then that also translates in the next slide to people who, again, small minority but important groups that have to be treated in our critical care facilities, this shows the proportion of people with COVID-19 in critical care beds. Again, that is falling in the four nations. And the absolute number of people in critical care beds, so not just the beds but the absolute number is also declining."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (19:49);And then finally we move unfortunately to deaths, the slide with deaths that occurred. Again, we’re not talking, we’re not doing deaths in all settings. We previously, up until a few days ago showing deaths in hospital settings. We’ve now expanded this. And again, you see those numbers do vary from day to day and there’s a reporting lag at the weekend, but over all the seven day rolling average, which smooths out those daily variation is showing that the number of deaths is beginning to trend downwards."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (20:20);Then very finally, we show the usual international comparison against other countries. And again this comes with a usual caveat that this sort of comparison is really important. It’s now U.K all settings, but a real comparison is in all cause mortality. So in SAS stats in countries that is measured more consistently between countries, but there will be some time before that analysis can be done. So although it’s important to show the data, I think it’s important to remember that it will be a number of months and perhaps longer before we can see the true comparison between our countries."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (21:03);So finally to remind people that the hardships we’ve been going through, the compliance, social distancing is working. The key thing is it needs to continue to work. So all must continue to not think that this is over. This is really beginning, but it is translating into benefits in pressure on the NHS and on reduction in deaths. So it’s important that we all keep it up. Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (21:27);Thanks very much Steve. So the first question is going to be from Andrew from Leeds who joins by video."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Andrew: (21:38);Hello. My question is when lockdown restrictions are lifted and schools open, will they find that people choose to keep their children out of school, even if it’s open for their age group? And also how will you make sure the public’s confident it’s safe?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (21:53);Well thanks, Andrew. That’s a really important question. The, our aim is when it is safe to do so, then we’ll make recommendations of changes like this. But we will only do it when it’s safe to do so. So we are not going to reopen schools if it isn’t safe. Now of course this disease thankfully doesn’t appear to give children symptoms nearly as bad as adults. So it is much, much, much safer for children. And maybe Professor [Patz 00:00:22:35], you can add something on that. But we will not reopen until it’s safe to do so. So that’s on your second question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (22:42);The first question, of course, you know as in when we reopen schools, our goal is to get back to the norm, and the position as it was before. And I’m pretty, I’m confident that because we’ll only do it when it’s safe then it will at that point then be entirely reasonable and become normal again to send children to school."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (23:08);Yes, so I think it’s as they’ve said, it’s perfectly correct that this virus affects children much less than it does the elderly and older adults. So they are much less acted by the effects of having COVID-19. As we said the last time we were here, there have been some very rare reports about complications in children. We are continuing to look for that and try and understand if there is any link. But the overall message is for children, this is a mild disease or it produces very little symptoms. The science is still evolving in term of transmission between children. So we do need to be cautious as we think about opening schools. We will need to think carefully and advise governments appropriate advice as to how that might happen. But the key thing is that this is not a serious disease for the vast, vast, vast majority of children and indeed younger people."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:10);In fact, it’s simple to remember, isn’t it, that the reason that we had to take the decision to close schools was because of the impact of schools on transmission, not on the safety of children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (24:21);Exactly, exactly."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:22);And that’s important to bear in mind and I hope reassuring, Andrew."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:26);The next question is from Stuart, from Redditch and Stewart asks, “Given the large investment that’s gone in creating the Nightingale Hospitals, will we make use of them going forward to help reduce NHS waiting lists at the right time as we come through the pandemic?”"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (24:44);The answer to your question, Stuart, is that we will do what we need to do to reduce NHS waiting lists as we reopen the NHS. But the Nightingales were designed very specifically for patients who are intubated and therefore they were under anesthetic. So they are specifically designed for COVID, but Steve, you were behind that project so maybe you can speak to that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (25:12);Yes, the Secretary is quite right. The Nightingale Hospitals have been designed with specific purposes in mind. The Nightingale Center in East London was created in order to be used if we needed extra capacity for ventilated patients. Fortunately we have used the Nightingales in London, but fortunately we have matched that surge because of the combined efforts of the British public to maintain social distancing. So the NHS has done a great job. But those hospitals are designed in a particular way for a particular purpose and that doesn’t necessarily mean that they would be fit for purpose for other type of NHS activity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (25:56);Now of course we also need to keep them as an insurance policy in the next month or two because we need to be confident, as I said in the five tests that we, that we have sustained reduction in hospital admissions. But of course we will always keep things under review going forward. But I think the key thing is that the Nightingale’s have shown quite how agile the NHS can be with the support of the military if we need to be, but I think have given us that extra capacity that we have used but haven’t had to use to the extent that we might’ve feared even just at the beginning of April."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (26:33);Thanks very much, and thanks, Stuart, for submitting your question. Remember that you can submit a question by going onto gov.uk/ask and I think these questions from the public are a great addition to our daily briefings. We’ll now turn to questions from the media. First one is from you, Hugh [Pemm 00:26:56], of the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh Pemm: (26:58);Thank you so much, Secretary of State. As you said, there’s clearly been a rapid and impressive expansion of lab capacity and testing centers and businesses and staff have put in a huge effort and are fully deserving of praise. I wanted to ask a little more about where we go from here. In your view, you touched on it but a little more detail. How do you intend to further develop and expand the testing network as part of the moves to combat the virus?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (27:27);Well, that’s a really important question, Hugh. I’d like to set out a bit of it, but I think there’s two parts. First is that we’ve grown this testing capacity to do over a hundred thousand 122,000 tests done yesterday. And that’s for purpose because by testing you can help to treat patients better. The more we’ve been testing patients, you can help get people back to work and there’s been a big expression of the eligibility to get a test in order to be able to get back to work. And also for…"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (28:03);… [inaudible 00:28:00] in order to be able to get back to work. And also for surveys and very soon we should get the first results of the surveys that are out in the field at the moment, so that we know how many people have the disease right across the country. And we should get those results very soon."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (28:19);We plan to continue to expand capacity. As I said, there’s a new lab coming on stream next week that AstraZeneca GSK have put together at Cambridge. And we’ll keep going from there. But the other really important question is making sure we use this capacity in the best way possible. For instance, to have a real focus on care homes, to make sure that we can tackle the epidemic within care homes as well. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (28:53);Thank you, Secretary of State. Yes, so it is an extraordinary achievement to build this [inaudible 00:28:59] so quickly. There is an element of consolidation required now. We need to move to a more sustainable footing. And we also need to try and integrate work of the new laboratories with existing infrastructure. So, for example, making sure that the results flow back to general practitioners and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (29:14);So all of that is happening and that will really help us to use this new capacity to its maximum benefit. And then as Secretary says, there are a whole range of other opportunities to support the NHS, the care sector, and also other sectors, such as criminal justice, by making testing available. And I think a really exciting development is this rollout of testing at home, which of course will be very, very helpful for any contract tracing, a really flexible, fast way of getting tests to people when we’re using our contact tracing, track and trace, and so on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (29:50);So we’re very pleased with what we’ve done so far, but it really is only a start. We do need to apply what we have now to the challenges of the future."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:03);Thank you-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (30:03);Thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:04);… very much. Yeah, have you got a follow-up, Hugh? Was that …"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh: (30:05);Just one more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:06);Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh: (30:06);Can you ensure that health and care workers do get priorities-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:10);Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Hugh: (30:10);… so can get tested when they need to be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:12);Yes, absolutely. This is really important. And within the system that we built, if health care workers need a test, then get one as a priority either through the NHS itself and the NHS’s own labs, or through the employer route so they can essentially go to the front of the queue in terms of getting an appointment to one of the drive through centers. And that’s an important part of making sure we have the right prioritization. We’ve always talked about the prioritization starting with patents and then people in the NHS, then [inaudible 00:30:51] workers and then the general public. And that prioritization is built into the system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (30:56);Just to build on this point of testing for contact tracing, thing is once we have contact tracing in large scale, then you want to be able to test people as soon as possible so that you know if there’s a positive test so that the people that have been in close contact with can be advised to act accordingly and isolate so that they don’t pass on the disease. So that is a very important other new part of the priority within testing once we get that up and running by the middle of the month. Thanks, Hugh. Sam Coates from Sky."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Sam Coates: (31:36);Matt Hancock, the 122,000 tests has obviously increased in a short period of time. How many of those are home testing kits that were mailed out yesterday, but haven’t actually been yet returned and analyzed by lab? Because earlier in the week, number [inaudible 00:31:52] was indicating that they wouldn’t count against the target, but now it does seem as if they do. To John Newton, perhaps this morning we got the news that we’ve been waiting for, that you cannot get coronavirus a second time. That seems to have come out of a study from the South Korea Central Clinical Committee for Emerging Disease Control. How much weight do you put on that seemingly important study and Steve [inaudible 00:32:15], so I was interested that you were seeming to be quibbling with a colleague at Public Health England, Dr. Okereke, who was saying yesterday that children don’t seem to be able to transmit the disease. Was she wrong?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (32:29);Right. Well, a feast of questions. I’ll hand over to Dawn to answer the precise numerical questions. We sat out on gov.UK exactly how we count the different types of tests for different reasons because obviously, exactly as you said the question, home tests are produced in a different way to the tests at drive through centers. So John can take us through the exact breakdown of the 122,347 tests yesterday. I’d just add that in total, we now, over the entire testing program since the test was invented, have done over a million tests. Now 1,023,824. So that’s another benchmark that we’ve managed to reach. John and then I’ll ask Steve to answer the question about the transmissability of disease amongst children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (33:27);Thank you, Secretary of State. So the NHS Public Health England’s laboratories, including the laboratories in other countries, all four countries of the UK, undertook 39,753 tests between them, of which the were 2,537 in Scotland, 1,019 in Wales, and 1,319 in Northern Ireland. And it’s worth mentioning, we have a partnership with Roche and that partnership, they undertook 13,703 tests. So that a benefit of the public private partnerships. The tests undertaken by the new Lighthouse Laboratories total 79,522. Now, of those 39,153 were undertaken in the drive through centers or by mobile units or in fact by research nurses who administered tests as part of the Office [inaudible 00:34:21] Statistics Survey."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (34:23);Your question, the home kits delivered, there were 27,497 kits delivered and there were 12,272 tests delivered through the satellite process. And then on the surveillance testing, which is a different, which is the antibody testing, there were 3,072 tests undertaken. And so that’s the breakdown of the total 122. So your question was about home kits, 27,000 and then there were 12,000 more that were sent out a satellites."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (35:01);Thanks very much. Steve."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Powis: (35:03);Thanks, [inaudible 00:35:04]. So on the question of transmission in children. I’ll say what I think the position is. John, with his public health expertise, will correct me if I get any of this wrong. I think if a child or a young person is symptomatic, then there’s no reason to think that they wouldn’t transmit the virus in the way that any other person who’s symptomatic would be. I think the big question is how many children don’t have symptoms, but get virus? And in that particular case or in those cases, how transmissible is the virus between them? And I think that is data that we are still accumulating, an evidence that we are still learning about. And of course it is one of the key questions when it comes to schools and how schools are opened again. So I think the true answer is that the evidence is still emerging over the transmitability of virus in children that don’t show symptoms. But John, is that your understanding?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (36:02);Yes, absolutely. And shall I pick up the question on immunity? Can you get the [inaudible 00:36:08]-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Powis: (36:07);Yes, [crosstalk 00:36:09]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (36:07);… twice. So you mentioned a study, the science on immunity is still emerging and I think the general rule is that you would never make a decision from a single study. So we would very much want to see that result replicated in other studies before we decide that that was really the case."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (36:27);But it’s obviously promising. I think people have said before in these briefings it would be very surprising if there was no immunity after an infection, but at the moment I think the science is still not precise about how much immunity you get and how long it lasts. So, but nevertheless results such as the one mentioned are encouraging."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (36:47);Thanks very much Sam. Victoria Macdonald from Channel 4."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Victoria Macdonald: (36:50);Thank you, Secretary of State. Can I just say that I’m not quite sure that Sam’s question was answered. There was a report in the HSJ that previously test would be counted only once the sample had been processed, but that that testing is now changed, that it’s being counted once it’s been posted out. Is that the case? And then Secretary of State, I wanted to ask you specifically, the OS figures today show that you are twice as likely to die from COVID-19 if you live in a deprived part of the country. What is your reaction to that and what policy implications does that have for you?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (37:29);Yeah, I’ll ask John to answer the point from the HSJ, but it’s not something I recognize. The point on deprivation and the point that in more deprived parts of the country that it appears to be a greater impact. This is something that we are worried about and looking at and we’re looking at it in the context of all of the different ways in which this disease seems to have a different impact on different groups. So right from the start we’ve known that it has a much more serious impact on older people, it appears to have a bigger impact on men, it appears to have a bigger impact on people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, it’s appears that people who are obese are more seriously affected by the disease, and there’s also this a new evidence from the Office for National Statistics of the correlation with deprivation. So we are looking all of these things and trying to understand the impact of the virus as much as we possibly can as and when we get new evidence. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John Newton: (38:50);Yeah. So there’s been no change to the way tests are counted. As we develop new ways of delivering tests, we’ve taken advice from officials as to how they should count it. So the tests that are within the control of the program, which is the great majority, are counted when the tests are undertaken in our laboratories. But for any test which goes outside the control of the program, they’re counted when they leave the program. So that’s the tests that are mailed out to people [inaudible 00:39:18], the tests that go out in the satellites. So that’s the way they are counted, have always been counted and the way we were advised to count them by officials."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (39:27);And that’s all set out on gov.UK. Sam Lister from the [inaudible 00:11:32]."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Sam Lister: (39:35);Thank you, Health Secretary. [inaudible 00:39:38] have been raised about how the over 70’s have been treated as [inaudible 00:39:42] in this crisis, including by senior figures in your party. Can you reassure over 70’s who are fit and healthy, that they’ll be treated exactly same as the rest of the population when lockdown measures are eased? And also it’s been made clear today that this is not over, but now we are past the peak people will obviously rightly be hopeful that they can start making plans to see family and friends again, perhaps even have a holiday, or meet up to go and have a holiday together. Is late summer a realistic timescale for this?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (40:20);Well, so the last question is very tempting to speculate at, but unfortunately we just don’t know. It’s still too early to say. I’m really sorry to have to give that answer, but it is. The five tests we’ve set out are there partly to try to give everybody a sense of when we’ll be able to make those next decisions that I know people are yearning for. But we will only lift the lockdown measures when safe to do so. This is why test, track, and trace is so important because it will help us to do that. It isn’t necessary to put that in place, but it helps enormously. But it is as of today too soon, and hence the message remains to stay at home because that protects the NHS and saves lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (41:16);And on your first point about the over 70’s, maybe Steve, I can ask you to answer, but we were always clear from the start. There’s a very specific group who we’ve been in contact with who we’re asking to shield, which is ensure that they have as little of contact as possible with other people for their own health reasons. And after that the question is a degree, a gradation of the [inaudible 00:13:44]. Steve?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Powis: (41:45);Yes, so of course we know, as you know, that that the over 70’s can be absolutely fit and healthy and that it’s not the case that everybody over 70 has a chronic health condition or an underlying disease. As the Secretary of State said-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (42:03);… or an underlying disease. As the Secretary of State said, we very specifically asked a group of individuals, some of whom are in that age bracket, but not everybody, to shield and to do everything they could to stay at home, because we knew that their underlying conditions put them more at risk of serious complications from COVID-19. So that’s the group that are being shielded. Of course, everybody is combined with social distancing measures at the moment, being asked to stay at home whatever age you are. So in the generality at the moment, everybody is in that same boat of complying with those measures."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (42:38);I think as we look forward, and as I said at the very start, the government moves to another combination of measures, including track and trace, that will help us keep the infection under control going forward. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable question to say, how would that work in age groups and age bands. Although we do know the complications, and unfortunately deaths, are more common in the elderly, even without complications, I think that’s a consideration, and that’s work, I think, that we will need to do as we move forward. But I think your point is very well met."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (43:20);Thanks very much, Sam. Allan Preston from the Belfast Telegraph."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Allan Preston: (43:26);Good afternoon. I just have two quick questions for the health secretary. Knowing Allan, the impact of coronavirus has not been quite as severe compared to the rest of the UK due to factors like a lower population density, do you think there’s any merit in eventually easing restrictions here at a different pace to other parts of the UK? My second question, as far as does not respect borders, do you think it would be better for Stormont work on an all-Ireland basis in fighting the pandemic rather than following UK lead?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (44:02);Well, thank you. The thing is, that across the UK, the level of the virus has been different in different parts of the country. We saw that in the chart earlier that in London the level’s been much higher, and other parts of the country lower. But what’s interesting is that the shape of the curve rise, and then the fall in the virus that’s just started has been basically the same throughout the country. So that means that moving together, I think it was the right approach at the start, and I can see the case that could be made, and of course, the decisions that are devolved with respect, the devolution settlement. But ultimately, if you look at the shape of the curve, getting our down and getting a level of new cases right down, that’s happened in the UK together. Of course the relationship with the Republic is important as well, and we have good relations in terms of political level, but also at a medical level and conversations with the Republic with the decisions that they take. We have very intensive discussions within the UK about the timing of changes within the country. Thanks very much. Steve Ford from the Nursing Times."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Ford: (45:30);Good afternoon, Nursing Time survey. As indicated, almost all nursing staff have been more stressed and anxious than usual. The third described the state their mental health is bad during the COVID-19 crisis for reasons including PPA shortages. So my question is, what are you going to do in the long-term to protect the mental health of nurses, other staff, on top of the help lines that have already been announced, as we already have a well-documented nurse shortage. I hope you’d agree that we can’t afford to lose any more in the coming months. And secondly, what’s your message to black and minority ethnic staff who feel they may have been put at great risk given the emerging evidence from the mortality data?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (46:11);Thank you very much, Steve. I think that the way that nurses across the HS have risen to this challenge has been admirable. The bravery and the flexibility that nurses have shown right across the NHS. I think that’s something the whole country recognizes it, and I recognize it as health secretary. I think that certainly the measures that we have put in place to help people with stress and more serious mental health as a result of work, those measures are important, and I’m very glad that they are place. I’ve been trying to get them in place for some time, and we’ve managed to put in place very quickly as the crisis began. But the other thing that is undoubtedly true when you talk to nurses on the front line, the decrease in the number of nurses, so that there are more to do the work that’s needed is a really important part of the part of the plan. As you know, we committed in the election to 50,000 more nurses by the end of parliament. We remain committed to that. In fact, we’ve seen more nurses come into the NAS over the autumn, and then also as a direct result of the appeal for nurses who’d left the profession to come back. So we have got more nurses in back into the NHS, and I want to support and cherish every single nurse who works in the NHS because of the important work that they do. So I’m sure that will be a big conversation as we restore the NHS and thank everybody for the work that they’ve done during the difficulty of coronavirus. Steve, I don’t know if you to add anything."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (48:06);I think your point, again, is a very good point. Of course, it’s not just nurses as you pointed out yourself. It’s all staff. There’s been a tremendous effort by staff across the NHS. They have been working incredibly hard, sometimes in different areas from where they usually work. Of course that brings its own stresses. I know talking to the chief execs and the medical director, executives, medical directors of many of our hospital trusts across the country that as we begin to now stand up some of the services that we have had to take down to manage the surge in coronavirus patients, those leaders locally are thinking very hard about how these support staff, because they absolutely recognize that they have gone through a very challenging, and at times very stressful number of weeks. That support is required both in the short-term and over a longer period of time to ensure as we move back towards a normal, that we can be back to normal while still have COVID, but back towards normal, that staff have the support they need. So I think the comments you’ve made are very much reflected in the comments I hear from all leaders across the health system."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (49:21);Maybe you could answer Steve’s second question as well."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (49:24);Second question, sorry. The second question, just remind me the second question was, Steve?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Speaker 3: (49:29);About the minority."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Ford: (49:30);Right, yes. Message for black and minority ethnics staff?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (49:34);Yes, and John might want to answer to some of this as well. I think the message for our black and minority staff is that we absolutely recognize, as secretary said earlier, that this virus is disproportionately affecting staff. I absolutely know the concern, the worry amongst our colleagues in those groups, and I’ve been talking to them over the last few weeks, as I’m sure were Secretary and others have. So there are things that we do in terms of supporting staff and helping them through the concerns that they have. I think there’s another piece of work that John will be able to talk about, which is to understand why it is, and secretary touched on this a little bit earlier, why it is that the virus seems to be disproportionately affecting members of staff and the population, the whole from particular ethnic groups. So that work is ongoing in public health. I think maybe John will be able to say a little bit, because of course, that will also inform what we need to do and the approach we need to take going forward. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John: (50:38);Thank you. As you know, then the statistics do show increased rates with some ethnic backgrounds. They’re relatively small, and they need to be looked at, although very important. But we do to also look at some of the other aspects of the virus. For example, the virus is present at different rates in different parts of the country, and we know that different parts of the country have very different people from different backgrounds. So we look at all of these figures together to try and understand what’s really going on, and that there is a cause for concern definitely. We are talking to NHS England about any advice that should be given based on the data. But there is also an important bit of statistical work to be done trying to understand what the real underlying risks are. Sometimes it can be wrong to take these statistics at face value."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","John: (51:39);We also know that, unfortunately, some ethnic groups have different levels of ongoing health conditions. So for example, people from Asian background tend to have more diabetes. So we’re trying to look at, to an extent, those factors might be there as well. But it’s a very important issue. One, a number of people are looking at, Public Health England, but also a number of university groups are also studying this, and we’re feeding the results back to NHS England so that staff can get right advice as you can accurately, as you say."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Professor Steve Powis: (52:08);But I think it’s important for us to emphasize that we don’t need to wait for that data. That data and analysis is important, but we don’t need to wait for that to provide additional support. In fact, when Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS wrote out to our healthcare organizations, to hospitals, this week, he made a specific point of ensuring that the local health care leaders who pay particular attention to supporting and do whatever they feel is necessary locally to support our BME colleagues. I know, from even today, talking to some of those local leaders that they are absolutely doing that and providing that support."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (52:50);Thanks very much, Steve. Does that answer your question?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Steve Ford: (52:53);Yes, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-1","Matt Hancock: (52:54);Thanks very much, indeed, everybody. That concludes this daily coronavirus briefing. Thank you."

"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (00:00);Before I do that, I just want to remind you of what we’re trying to achieve. Our plan is to slow the spread and to protect the NHS so that the NHS is always there for you and your family whenever you need it, whether for Coronavirus or anything else. That goal is working. The number of spare critical care beds in the NHS is 3,413. On the latest figures, there have been 1,291,000 tests for Coronavirus including 85,186 tests on Sunday, yesterday."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (00:43);190,584 people have now tested positive for Coronavirus, an increase of 3,985. 13,258 people are in hospital with Coronavirus and 28,734 people have died. That’s across all settings, an increase of 288. That figure is lower than at any point since the end of March. But as with testing, these reported figures tend to be lower over the weekend, so we do expect that number to rise. And remember, this is not just a number, but it is a constant insistent reminder that we must go further and faster in our national effort in dealing with this virus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (01:42);Over the last month, we’ve built a national testing infrastructure capable of over 100,000 tests a day. Today the capacity stands at 108,000. This means we’re now in a position to start implementing the next part of our plan, track and trace. The aim of test, track and trace is to hunt down and isolate the virus so it’s unable to reproduce. And crucially test, track and trace allows us to take a more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease. Creating this system is a huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity. We’ve already taken Britain’s small but brilliant diagnostics industry and taken it to global scale."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (02:32);We’re building an army of human contact tracers who can man the phones and find the contacts and support people. And of course we’re developing the contact tracing app which can help us deliver test, track and trace on the mass scale that we need across the country. The app, which takes full consideration of privacy and security, has already been tested in closed conditions at an RAF base. And today I can announce the next steps. From tomorrow, we will begin to pilot test, track and trace on the Isle of Wight starting with health professionals and rolling out this week to all citizens."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (03:13);I’m grateful to the huge enthusiasm shown by islanders who know that by participating in this pilot, they’re at the forefront of helping get Britain back on her feet. Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows. The island has a single NHS trust, one local authority with the responsibilities for public health, a relatively low number of COVID cases and because it’s an island, we can run this trial in proper, scientifically controlled conditions comparing the effect with what’s going on on the mainland before we roll it out to the rest of the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (03:53);So here’s how it’ll work. Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island. From tonight, the contact tracing capability will go live and then tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. And from Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be asked to install the app. Once you’ve installed the app, it’ll start logging the distance between your phone and other phones with an app nearby."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (04:29);It’s been designed with a form of Bluetooth that conserves power so the app won’t drain your battery, and this log of proximity information will then be securely stored on your phone. If you become unwell with COVID symptoms, you inform the NHS via the app. All the app users who you’ve had significant contact with in the last few days will then be sent an alert by the NHS along with advice about what to do. A test ordering function will then be built in."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (05:04);If you’re watching this and you live on the Isle of Wight, I have a simple message. Please, download the app to protect the NHS and save lives. By downloading the app, you’re protecting your own health, you’re protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community. I know the people of the Isle of Wight will embrace this with enthusiasm because by embarking on this project and by embracing test, track and trace, you will be saving lives."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (05:43);The pilot is important so we can help make sure the app works as well as it possibly can alongside the contact tracing system. And with your help, we’ll learn a lot. We’ll use it to make things better and we want to hear from you. I want to stress, and this is really important, that this trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight or anywhere else for that matter. We will only change the social distancing rules once our five tests are met. So I’ll end with the instruction that we all know. Please stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Or if you live on the Isle of Wight, stay at home, install the app, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now turn to Professor Van-Tam to take us through the day’s charts. Jonathan."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (06:40);Thank you secretary of state. So let’s begin again with refreshing the five tests that we have in place for deciding if we’re going to adjust the lockdown. The first is around NHS capacity and we’re in a good position on that one. The second one is about a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus and it is now very clear in the data that we are past the peak. The next one is solid information that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. This is an indicator that we need to keep a close eye on over the next few days and weeks."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (07:33);The fourth one is around operational challenges around testing and PPE and being able to meet future demand. There are continuing challenges on PPE. It is an absolute priority to continue pushing on this to get it right in the long-run. But of course on testing as you’ve heard from the secretary of state, we’re in a very good position. And finally we have to be confident that the adjustments we contemplate are not going to risk a second peak of infections. And this is really a matter of deep scientific discussion, very, very close following and absorbing of the evidence and one that we’re keeping under detailed scientific review as the days and weeks go by. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (08:28);Now this slide actually shows search data of people looking at Apple Maps for directions over driving, over walking routes or over using public transport. It tells the same story as slides you have seen before about how since we announced these social distancing measures, the public continue to observe the instructions to work with us to protect the NHS and get case numbers down. And you can see very, very consistent trends over reduced searches for driving instructions, walking instructions and use of public transport. So, we need to keep going. Let’s keep going and continue to drop the curve further. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (09:25);This is a graph showing from the 6th of April through to the 4th of May daily tests completed for Coronavirus. You can see on the right hand side the latest data showing 85,000 tests completed on the 4th of May. Our capacity is 108,000 tests and there is another lab opening next week. This is all very encouraging. Tests are going up, people are using testing services more and we are well within our capacity capability. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:10);Now this slide shows new cases of Coronavirus in the UK. From the 21st of March, you can see that obvious peak up to a high level in early April. And then you can see the pattern that has occurred in terms of new cases right up until the 4th of May. On this one, I have to say that new cases need to come down further. We have to continue to track this index and we have to get cases lower."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (10:47);If you look to the next slide please, here we array the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 from 17th of March through to the 3rd of May. And after peaks in the middle of April, you can see that in almost all areas now there are steady but absolutely consistent declines occurring. Possibly in a small number of areas, the trend is somewhat flat, but overall there are now steady declines in the number of people in hospital. This is good news."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (11:26);Following on please, the next slide. Critical care beds, ICU beds. Here again across all four nations you can see largely continuing declines and possibly a more important point, if you look at the axis on the left of the slide, the Y axis, you can see where we are in terms of capacity and there is plenty of ICU capacity which is extremely good. Next slide please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (11:56);I turn now to deaths in all settings. Here you can see that there is a slow but consistent decline. You will see the weekend effect very clearly, especially if you look at the three steps on the right hand side of the chart. Fewer deaths are actually recorded, reported at the weekends. That’s an artifact of the way people report deaths. But overall if you look at the orange line, the seven-day smoothed out rolling average, there is this slow but consistent decline which is absolutely going in the right direction now."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (12:36);And then the final slide is one we have shown for some time showing a comparison across countries dating back to the day when 50 cumulative deaths were recorded in each of the countries and we’re now quite a way across the slide to 60 odd days in some of the countries. The message is the same as I’ve said to you before that there are kind of three broad trends on this curve, but I do want to emphasize to you these are numbers, they are not rates."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (13:13);They do not adjust for the size of the underlying population, and this is a difficulty in interpreting these data. We will in the course of time be able to get all-cause, age-adjusted, excess mortality for many of the countries on this slide. And that will give us a much clearer understanding of what is going on. And hopefully those data will continue for a long period of time so that we can understand the fullness of the picture as we try to beat this virus. I will stop there with the data and hand back to the secretary of state."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (13:50);Thank you very much Jonathan. And we’re now going to take questions. And the first question is from a member of the public. We have a video from Zack Lane from London."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Zack Lane: (14:02);What is being done to ensure that BAM key workers are not disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and what steps have been taken to provide support to the families of those victims who have sadly passed away?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (14:19);Thank you, Zack Lane, an incredibly important question, two incredibly important questions, both of which we’re working hard to address. And I’m going to ask Jonathan to set out the details, but what I’d say absolutely from the start is that we recognize that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away, especially amongst care workers and those in the NHS. And I paid tribute to them before and I will do so again because the NHS is an amazing organization that has been built on the dedication of people from all backgrounds and this including many, many who’ve come to this country to give their lives working in the NHS and disproportionately employs people from ethnic minority backgrounds, and yet we have seen this impact in the data. And I think it’s affected a lot of us working on it to see that, and so we’ve got a lot of work going into fully understand scientifically and make sure that in every single case we learn what we can to protect people better."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (15:44);In terms of support for the families of those who’ve passed away, for those working in the NHS, we now have a program of support that we’ve been able to put in place that is there for everybody who is from a family where somebody has died whilst in service, including across pharmacy, across social care, and so I think that’s a really important thing for us to do, to recognize the sacrifice of those who put themselves at risk by going to work in what can be dangerous conditions where they might be working with those who have COVID-19. John."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:31);Yes. I’m extremely sorry whenever I hear of a healthcare worker death due to coronavirus, whether it’s someone from a black and minority ethnic group or otherwise. It doesn’t change the fact that it takes courage to work in the NHS at a time like this and it’s most difficult."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (16:55);On the subject of the signal that we have so far on black and minority ethnic groups, I want to say to you that we are taking it incredibly seriously. There is a very big piece of scientific work now ongoing that will report to the Chief Medical Officer and we’ll get to the bottom of this however long it takes us. But I will also say that this is a complicated picture because when you start to study patterns of disease across different ethnic groups, you also have to take into account potential differences in the age structure between groups, also differences in the patterns of underlying medical conditions, which we know do vary by ethnic group and therefore it’s a complicated picture. And also deprivation has to be taken into account where people live. And all of this is complex, it takes time and I’m not going to rush the answer. I think we owe it to minority ethnic groups to get this right and get a clear signal for you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (18:11);And you’ll have worked out that I’m from an ethnic minority group and we will get to the bottom of this. It could be that professor Newton has some further epidemiological granularity he’d like to add on this point."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (18:25);Thank you, Jonathan. Well, just to say that we are, as you say, looking at the data very carefully, not just on ethnicity but also on age, sex and other factors such as obesity, which we know do have an impact on the effect of coronavirus. But it’s already clear from some of the published data that the impact in BME groups is greater, that there are more people with the infection and those who have the infection have worse outcomes in many cases. So there is already cause for concern, but as Jonathan says, it’s not entirely clear how much of that is due to different levels of underlying conditions or other risk factors. So there is work to be done and we will be publishing this as soon as it’s ready."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (19:03);Thank you very much. Thank you, Zack Lane. The next question is from Conrad from Ashford. And Conrad asks, “Going forward, will the primary aim of test, track and trace be to squash the occurrence of COVID-19 infection to very low levels or simply to flatten the curve enough that the NHS is not overwhelmed?” And that is a really important question, Conrad. The answer is that test, track and trace will help us to get the R down and to get the number of new cases down and to keep it down, but not on its own. It’s primarily the social distancing measures that we’ve taken so far that have flattened the curve and now we can see that the curve is going down from the presentation that professor Van-Tam just gave. The goal is to keep the number of new infections going down and bring in the test, track and trace."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (20:01);We’re at a point, which we will do from tomorrow in the Isle of Wight and then rolling out to the rest of the country, we will get those numbers down, the test, track and trace becomes more effective the lower the number and then we want to keep the number going down by keeping the R below one, the rate of infection. So our goal is not simply to flatten the curve, it is to get the occurrence of COVID-19 infections to very low levels, to be absolutely clear within your question that that is the answer. Thanks very much."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (20:41);We’ll now take questions from the media. Hugh Pym from the BBC."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Hugh Pym: (20:47);Thank you very much. When will you have recruited your 18,000 contact traces and when will the full test, track and trace network be up and running?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (20:59);The aim is to have the whole thing up and running by the middle of this month. We’re starting already. We’ve already started the recruitment. Of the 18,000 we have thousands already recruited and we are making very rapid progress, not only in the recruitment but also the training that’s necessary, a short piece of training. And we have enough to get going on the Isle of Wight. In fact, they came on stream as of five o’clock this evening so that’s up and running now, and then to roll out across the country. But there’s no magic around the 18,000 figure. That is the initial scale that we think is necessary. If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that’s in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is, the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests, then we’ll adjust that figure. That’s the initial goal, but it’ll be up and running by the middle of the month."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Hugh Pym: (22:08);Can I ask one more?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (22:09);Of course."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Hugh Pym: (22:11);On business, some businesses will be required to have PPE for their staff, where will they procure it and will they be in competition with the NHS?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (22:20);Well, this is a really important important question when we consider changes to the social distancing measures. The wider impact of changes to social distancing measures, including for instance on PPE, on the first call on PPE must go to the NHS and social care and those other essential services who need it to keep the people delivering those services, safe. So that is something that we take into account. It’s in our five tests, but it is something that we’re working very hard on now. Of course, it’s our job in running the health and social care system to ensure that those areas and the other public services have PPE, and there’s a worldwide shortage as you say, so we do need to take that into consideration before making changes. And that’s why it’s one of the five tests. Thanks very much. Tom Clark from ATV."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (23:27);Thank you, Secretary of States. The most successful contact tracing efforts around the world, like those of Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, were only partly reliant on mobile phone technology in order to work. They were more aligned on large numbers of volunteers on the community level going out to track down and trace cases at a huge scale. Has the government ensured this capacity is in place in the UK or are we putting too much faith in call centers and in untested digital technologies [crosstalk 00:24:02] may be?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (24:04);It’s a really important point and I agree with the points in the question, which is that it isn’t just about the technology and the people in call centers, it’s also about citizens acting in the right way, acting in the right way to download the app because that protects you and protects your family and protects the NHS, but also acting in the right way to do contact tracing yourself. John?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (24:29);Yeah, so it’s a really good point, well made. The app is very exciting and the app adds something extra, it adds an automated response that can be almost immediate. But as you say, the program that we’re putting in place is an integrated program with the app, but also with contact tracing driven by testing. So access to testing partly through the app, but also other routes to the test. And then the test result backed up by contact tracing driven by public health professionals. At one level we’ve got public health England, but also a lot of experience on the ground with directors of public health and local authorities, environmental health officers who are very expert in this exactly as you say, shoe-leather epidemiology out on the streets, finding contacts."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (25:11);But even actually as what people call traditional contact tracing isn’t very traditional anymore. It’s quite highly technical. So we’ve developed a web based support, the contact tracing and advisory service, which has been ramped up to support this, and there’s also another line of defense through the telephone call center. So it’s a multi- layered approach. And one of the points of the Isle of Wight test, pilot, is to try and see how those different elements integrate together to support each other. So it’s a very good point, we are learning from the best practice around the world, but we also have something to offer in the UK as well because we’ve been doing this for a long time."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (25:48);Thanks, Tom. I hope that answers your question."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (25:51);Yes. I may have a quick follow question. Are we caught in something of a catch 22 with contact tracing? As I understand it, the numbers of cases have to fall quite a bit more before we can reliably roll it out across the country, but if we keep locked [inaudible 00:12:07], which we have to until your fifth test is met, it’s quite hard to pilot contact tracing because most of us are trying to isolate ourselves as much as possible."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (26:19);No is the short answer. And the slightly longer answer is that even with social distancing measures, there still are some new cases that means that the technology can still be effective. And even with the scale of new cases across the country, contact tracing can still have an impact and the app will still be highly effective. It’s just more effective the fewer the number of new cases. So these are all matters of degree rather than absolute. So we’re not caught in a catch 22, but it is absolutely true that the social distancing measures, all the thing that is doing there, having the big impact. And so hence the message remains, stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. Unless you’re in the Isle of Wight. But even in the Isle of Wight, you should still stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. It’s that you should also install the app because that will help this to be yet more effective."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (27:35);One final point on this, which is the Isle of Wight has a slightly lower rate of new COVID infections than some other places in the country and therefore actually is a … That makes it a good place to test this. Not only is it good because it will help the Isle of Wight, but it is also good because it has that slightly lower number of new infections."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (28:01);There’s lockdown measures until-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Tom Clark: (28:03);… contact tracing is up and running across the country?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (28:07);No. The two aren’t necessarily linked like that. We haven’t said that we can’t make changes before it’s up and running. It’s just that the test, track, and trace system will help us to get R down and hold R down. And the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be. But we haven’t made a concrete link that your question drew between having this system in place nationally and making changes to the social distancing measures. There isn’t a necessary link between the two. They do work in tandem. The next question is from Oliver Dyer from Isle of Wight Radio."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Oliver Dyer: (28:54);Evening, all. In a poll that Isle of Wight Radio ran today, 80% of our listeners said they would install this new app. But the Island has a higher than average elderly population who fall into the government’s vulnerable category. How are you expecting those who don’t have a smart phone or can’t use that technology, be it on the Island or across the country, to get behind this. And with that in mind, considering the Island has an elderly population, one of the questions our listeners wants to know is, why the island is being chosen over other U.K. islands or locations?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (29:26);So, look, that’s a great set of questions, Oliver. And I’m really, really pleased to hear that 80% of people said that they would download the app. Because the more people who download the app, the more effective it’s going to be because you need two people having downloaded the app for it to be effective, for one to be able to tell the other that they’ve been in close contact with somebody who’s got symptoms of COVID-19. So, I’m really pleased that the people of the Isle of Wight have responded today in this way. I had a feeling that they would. And I’m really glad that they have."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (30:01);But, partly because of the challenges that you set out, that not everybody has a smartphone, that’s another reason actually to test it in the Isle of White. Because, if we tested it somewhere where it would be easy, we wouldn’t find as many of the challenges, rather than testing it somewhere where you’ve got to have the technology, but you’ve got to have the human contact tracing as well. They go hand in hand. They help each other. And so, that is actually one of the things we thought about before choosing the Isle of Wight as the place to go first. John, do you?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (30:43);Yeah. Thank you. I mean, I think the Isle of Wight is an ideal place to do this. It’s quite a large population and there is a benefit in the fact that travel on and off the Island is relatively restricted. The ferries are there but they’re running relatively infrequently. So it is an ideal place to look at the epidemiology and see the impact. And it’s also, I used to be the regional director of Public Health for South Central, including the Isle of Wight. I know that the Island is very well equipped to respond to things like this. It’s a very coherent group. We’ve had tremendous support from the local authority, from the NHS, from the local MP. And, like everybody else, I think is going to be a great success as a pilot."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:22);Your point about elderly people, firstly we shouldn’t make assumptions. I mean, quite a lot of elderly people that are extremely tech savvy and quite happy to use smartphones. But we’ve also recognized that there are other ways of doing contact tracing. So, as I mentioned, we’ve built in a number of routes. So, people don’t have to have the app in order to benefit. But, of course, we will all benefit. If the app and the contact tracing drives down the infection rate, it drives down the infection rate for everybody."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (31:48);And I think the third point to say is that the people who are most mobile and most likely to be out bumping into each other are also the people who are probably most likely to be using smartphones. So, I think, all in all, we think it’s a strong program. And we’re looking forward to see how it works in the Isle of Wight. And that survey is extremely encouraging. So, thank you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (32:07);Does that answer your questions, Oliver?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Oliver Dyer: (32:09);It does. Yeah. Am I allowed one more followup?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (32:11);Go ahead."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Oliver Dyer: (32:12);Fantastic. So, obviously, whilst a lot of people, a lot of Isle of Wight Radio listeners in particular have been positive about the app, there are some concerns that the lockdown measures could be lifted here early to form part of that trial. Could lock down on the Isle of Wight be lifted earlier than the rest of the U.K.? And, if so, is it safe to do so?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (32:30);Well, I want to thank Isle of Wight Radio listeners for how much they’ve engaged with this idea today. And I can reassure you that there aren’t any changes to social distancing measures that are proposed as part of this pilot. The pilot is to find out how the app works, how the interaction of people then becomes recognized by the technology and the link from that to the human contact tracing, and to the testing regime, because there’s a new testing center on the Isle of Wight as well. So, there aren’t changes. Our proposals are that changes to the social distancing will only take place when the five tests are met. And that’s nationally rather than the Isle of Wight having any differences in that part to the rest of the country. Thanks very much indeed, Oliver. Joe Murphy from the Evening Standard."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Joe Murphy: (33:38);Good afternoon. Can I ask the scientists, how has your understanding of immunity developed over the last month or so? Do you know yet whether people will catch it again? And how are the tests developing? How are the testing of the tests going? Do you see antibodies and immunity playing a really significant role in easing out of lockdown or not? And, Secretary of State, if I could just ask a follow to Conrad’s question, who asked how low the numbers would go. You said very low. Can you put a figure on that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (34:14);The answer to the second question is, no. And the answer to the first question is, I’ll say a little and then I’ll ask both scientists to come in, John on the testing and JVT on the science of immunity."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (34:31);What I’d say is that antibody testing is incredibly important. We have antibody tests in the field at the moment. They’re being used for surveys. They are lab based, rather than the automatic response tests that we looked into in great detail a month or so ago. But then, none of them were effective enough to be used for clinical reasons. But they can still be used for surveys. So, we have surveys in the field, both with the stick tests and also with lab based serology which detects antibodies. So, we will be getting estimates soon of the proportion of the population who have the antibodies. The test tests for whether the antibodies are there. The effect of the antibodies on your risk to catching or transmitting Coronavirus in the future is the next important step in that. And the science on that has been rapidly developing. And I’ll ask JVT to update on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (35:38);Yes. Thank you for the question. So, on antibodies, one of the things we want to know is, when you’ve had a COVID-19 infection, do you get antibodies? Do they protect you against further instances of the same illness? And how long are they going to protect you for? So, that’s kind of three questions really. So, let’s chop this up into three answers."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (36:08);And the first answer is, the first thing we wanted to know was, once you’ve had confirmed COVID-19 infection, do you get antibodies? And one of the things that we’ve been interested in and want to do is call people back who’ve had COVID-19 for sure and who’ve recovered to ask them if they’ll begin to take part in a program we’re starting to get plasma containing antibodies and use it for treatment in the future in trials to understand if it’s going to work and save lives. And the good news on that is that program has started. And the overwhelming majority of people so far called back who’ve had definite COVID-19 infection have got antibodies in their bloodstream, which is a good news thing. So, those antibodies take different times in different people to develop. But, by and large, the signal is that people get antibodies."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:14);The next question is, do those antibodies protect you from further infections? And we just haven’t had this disease around on the planet in humans for long enough to know the answers to that with any surety. And that’s a piece of science that we will just have to follow a bit longer. I hope the answer is yes. But I think it’s one where we have to be much clearer before we can take that responsibility of giving you a very clear answer on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (37:47);And then, the final piece is, how long will the antibodies last? And we do know that for other normal Coronaviruses, if that’s the right word, the ones that are a couple of viruses that, together with many others, cause what we’d call the common cold, that those antibodies don’t persist necessarily for years, and years, and years. Now, it doesn’t follow that that’s going to be the case with COVID-19. We do not know at this point. We will have to simply follow people who’ve recovered and test them repeatedly until we have an understanding of how long antibodies last and how long they protect for."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (38:33);But there is an absolutely massive piece of work now underway, multiple studies, to look for antibodies in different populations in the U.K. and, indeed, to follow some people who’ve recovered for long periods of time into the future, at least a couple of years. And we will have much clearer signals over time. But I’m afraid it’s just one of those where we can’t make the science go any faster than how quickly our bodies go in terms of maintaining the antibodies. And, like everybody else in the world, we just have to be patient and cautious until we get those answers. But I do believe, in the long run, once we have those kinds of answers, potentially antibody testing will be a very important part of our future strategy."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (39:26);Thanks. In fact, I’m in one of those trials, because I was tested positive. And now, fairly regularly somebody comes and takes blood to test whether I have antibodies. And then, also to test whether I get it again, because we have surveys in the field right now to test if people with antibodies then catch the disease, which is an absolutely critical fact will then determine policy over what we say people with antibodies who’ve tested positive on an antibody test can do. Which is, at the moment, we don’t yet have the science to make those policy decisions, but it will be absolutely critical. John, did you have anything to add on the testing?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Jonathan Van-Tam: (40:11);Just briefly on the testing, there’s been really very good progress on the antibody tests. There are at least two large, commercial organizations who have developed good lamp based antibody tests, which we’re currently evaluating. But also, people looking at ways of doing antibody tests close to the person, the patient. And there are a number of options there including a saliva test. And all of these options are looking quite promising and being evaluated. So, I think, in general, we can say, as we thought, that there would be antibody tests available when we needed them. And they will support also our contact tracing program and strategy later on."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (40:47);Fantastic. Follow up?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Joe Murphy: (40:49);If I may, Secretary of State, and thank you all three for very informative answers there. Secretary of State, life is full of risks. And this is all about balance of risks. You are somebody who has probably got antibodies. Would you feel happy going into a crowded room?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (41:04);Not yet. Not yet. I very much hope that the science shows that the people with antibodies who tested positive for having antibodies have a low risk of transmitting the disease and the low risk of catching it. Both are important because low risk of catching it to protect me, low risk of transmitting it to protect others. I very much hope that that’s where the science comes out. That is true of most Coronaviruses. But we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got the science. Because, until we know that’s the case, we can’t be sure of it. We can’t base a policy decision on it. And I can’t be comfortable doing what you mentioned in the question because that might simply trigger a rise in the number of infections if the science turns out to be wrong. And there are so many novel things about this Coronavirus."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (42:03);There are so many things that are different to previous… There’s the six existing coronaviruses, that we do have to test this and not base our assumptions on how other coronaviruses behave, because we don’t want to take the risk of assuming this coronavirus behaves like other coronaviruses before saying and taking a policy decision that people with antibodies are lower risk. But if the science concludes that they are, then we’ll take decisions on that basis. And I would say, this point of John’s, that there’s been big advances in antibody testing, especially the lab-based antibody testing, is very important. Today, Roche, the Swiss global diagnostics company, made a very positive announcement about progress with their antibody test, and we’re in discussions with them about a very large scale rollout of antibody testing, as well as with some others who may be able to bring this forward. But there’s been false hope before in antibody testing, and so we’ll make announcements when we’re absolutely ready. Thanks very much, Joe. Paul Waugh from the Huffington Post."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Paul Waugh: (43:20);Health Secretary, as you’ve frequently said, the longterm solution to this pandemic is a fully scaled up vaccine for COVID-19."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (43:28);Yeah."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Paul Waugh: (43:28);But a vaccine relies on as many people as possible actually taking it up. Now you told HuffPost last year, and I quote, “There’s a very strong argument for having compulsory vaccinations for children for when they go to school, because otherwise they’re putting other children at risk.” Would that apply to a COVID vaccine, as well as to MMR and other vaccines? And what are the measures are you looking at to ensure as many adults and children take up the new vaccine when it’s available? And if I can, to Professor Van-Tam, can I ask you what you’ve made of the early academic research done in Harvard, Germany and even Cambridge, that suggests high levels of air pollution may be one of the most important contributors to the clustering of deaths from COVID-19? Is SAGE looking at that, or going to look at that?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (44:11);Thanks, Paul. Two very good questions. On the vaccine, the first and most important thing is that we support the development of the vaccine. And you all have seen the Prime Minister’s excellent announcement today. And then, that we also do the work to ensure that people can get access to the vaccine, starting with those who are most vulnerable. And on the question of whether to make it compulsory, I think that the extent of the public’s reaction to following the lockdown, shows that we will be able to achieve very, very high levels of vaccination without taking that step. And so, our task is to ensure that it is, in the first instance, we support the science as much as possible, because we can’t assume there’ll be a vaccine. There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. And for any of the existing coronaviruses, and this is uncertain science. But whilst I don’t rule anything out, we’re proceeding on the basis that just such a huge proportion of the population are going to take this up, because of the obvious benefits to individuals, and their families, and their communities, and indeed, the whole nation, that there’ll be enormous demand for it, as and when the science is safe to proceed."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Van-Tam: (45:35);Yes, thank you Secretary of State. So, just to stay on the vaccine question for a little longer, we are following the developments in vaccine research across the world, including in the UK. We remain very hopeful that there will be a breakthrough at some point in the future. I think what I can say to you is that it is more likely than not, that the first vaccines will be licensed in adults in the first instance, and therefore, what has to put some caveats around your question around children. And the other thing to say is that, so far, the epidemiological evidence is not showing us that there is a massive burden of disease or burden of mortality in children. It is actually completely at the other end of the scale. It is in the elderly. And so, from that perspective, again, that’s another caveat I’d add to your question about vaccinating children."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Van-Tam: (46:42);On the second question about air pollution, and thank you for that, I think we already have very solid data that air pollution contributes to a whole range of mortality, particularly from respiratory illnesses, and respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular disease. I have heard it said, about air pollution and COVID-19. I have not personally studied those data and looked at that question in detail, but what you say is entirely plausible, in my view. Professor Newton may have some further observations on air pollution."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (47:24);Well, only your general point that we know that air pollution, because it’s so pervasive and affects so many people, has a huge burden. But like Jonathan, I haven’t looked at those papers, but I think there’s something that we-"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (47:34);Right. I think we’ll get back to you, Paul. The scientists will get back to you."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Paul Waugh: (47:38);Yeah, just one brief followup, Secretary of State. Do you have a message for those anti-vaxxers here and abroad, when and if we do get a vaccine for COVID-19?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (47:49);I think there has been no greater demonstration in modern history that vaccines save lives, than the need for a vaccine to save lives and to get the world going again, following the outbreak of COVID-19, and we will only license a vaccine when it is both effective, and safe, and when the independent regulators… If and when the independent regulators license a vaccine in this country, they will do so knowing that it is safe, and everybody should follow that advice. Thanks very much. Finally, we’re going to go to Louise Hill from the Isle of Wight County press."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Louise Hill: (48:42);Thank you Mr. Secretary. As a local democracy reporter out on the Isle of Wight, I have seen a mixed reaction to the app, but a main concern that keeps occurring is whether you can assure island residents who are wary of using the app and this technology, that their data will be kept fully protected and private throughout this trial and going forward, and the government will be fully transparent with islanders about the way this app works."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (49:06);Yes, absolutely. This is an incredibly important question. I was very glad to hear from Oliver from Isle of Wight Radio, on his initial survey, there was a very high degree of support for the app and for downloading it, but the app has been designed with privacy and security front of mind. It’s been signed off by the National Cyber Security Center, who’ve been involved in its development, and I want to thank them and pay tribute to the work that they’ve done in ensuring that the privacy and cybersecurity is strong. The data is stored on in individual’s phone, not by the NHS, until somebody finds that they’ve got symptoms, and then they need a test, and so they need to connect to the NHS. And then, the NHS needs to contact those who you’ve been in contact with. And so, this has the highest level of privacy built in to make sure that we can both reassure people, in terms of privacy, but also, that it can be effective and save lives. I don’t know if you’ve got anything to add on that."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Professor Newton: (50:20);Well, no. Exactly right, Secretary, but just to be absolutely clear, the app itself doesn’t hold any personal information. It just has information about the phone, where it was, which other phones it’s been in contact with, but only using anonymized randomly generated numbers. And those are the data that are collated. So, no personal information is contained by the app, or generated by the app. As the Secretary said, the only personal information used is when somebody approaches the NHS to have a test, or to have their contact traced. So, it’s a very safe use of data, and people should feel very reassured by all the precautions that have been taken."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (50:59);Thanks very much indeed. Thank you, from the Isle… Have you got a follow up? You’ve got it… Yes."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Louise Hill: (51:04);Sorry. Yes, please."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (51:04);No, sure."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Louise Hill: (51:06);So, as you said earlier, we’re told the lockdown won’t be eased on the island as part of the rollout of this app. That means people are already either at home or making very limited trips. And as the app is predominantly aimed at the islands key workers, will that guarantee enough useful data for the app, going forward?"
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (51:26);This is a really important question that we thought about when selecting where to try it. Because there’s a busy hospital on the island, and there’s other key workers, including those who work for the counsel, for instance, and in the other services right across the board, there are interactions, and there are new cases on the island, and so we think that it will be effective, and it will be an effective place to pilot. But also, we think that the Test, Track and Trace system, as a whole, will be more effective when there are fewer new cases, because then, when you do find a new case, we can really support that person, find out who they’ve been in contact with, and then contact all of those people, and we can put quite a lot of effort and support into then, trying to stop that case from spreading any further."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (52:29);So actually, the Test, Track and Trace system, as a whole, will be more effective when there’s fewer cases, and currently, there are fewer cases on the island than there are in the rest of the country."
"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/united-kingdom-coronavirus-briefing-transcript-may-4","Matt Hancock: (52:41);Thank you very much indeed. Thanks for all the questions from the public, from the national media, from the Isle of Wight. And I’m very grateful for this opportunity to have sat out these details of our Test, Track and Trace program, and look forward to seeing you again, from here in Downing street very soon. Thanks very much."
