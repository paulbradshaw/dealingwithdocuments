One of the officers alleged that they sighted two men involved in a drug exchange.\\nThe officers approached the men and detained them under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\\nDuring the search, one of the men was handcuffed and the officers also searched a vehicle belonging to one of the men. No drugs were found. One of the men was also arrested when a credit card was found in his possession, which was issued to a different name. The man was later de-arrested when it was confirmed that the credit card belonged to his girlfriend.\\nThe search caused community tensions with members of the public surrounding the incident.\\nDuring this investigation, our investigators obtained extensive body worn video and mobile phone footage for the police stop and search. We also obtained the relevant search records, statements from the two men who were searched and initial statements from all six officers.\\nOur investigators contacted various independent witnesses, but none provided statements. We also made efforts to obtain further accounts from the officers involved, but they refused to provide further comment to the IOPC.\\nThe video footage and statements available were analysed thoroughly for any evidence of racial discrimination, misconduct or criminality. The lead investigator did not identify any objective evidence that justified the bringing of criminal proceedings or that the officers had breached any Standards of Professional Behaviour.\\nWe shared our report with the MPS who agreed with our conclusions.\\nAdditionally, our\\xa0investigation\\xa0identified learning from this\\xa0investigation\\xa0which was considered as part of a wider piece of work the IOPC did to study five stop and search cases which occurred in the MPS.\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'The IOPC completed five investigations involving the stop and search of Black men by MPS officers.

class=\"content\">\\n    \\n            <p>On 9 March 2020, a Northumbria Police officer on mobile operational duties in an unmarked police car attempted to change lanes to follow a suspect car. During the manoeuvre the police car collided with a Vauxhall Astra forcing it off the road and into the corner of a building. The driver of the Astra sustained a serious chest injury during the collision.</p><p>We obtained statements from the police driver involved in the collision and two police witnesses who assisted at the scene of the collision. Northumbria Police also provided us with witness statements obtained from the driver and front seat passenger of the Astra.</p><p>The available evidence indicated that the police driver had received the appropriate training to carry out the operational activity and that the collision occurred due to a minor error of judgement.</p><p>The <span class=\"taxonomy-tooltip-element\" rel=\"taxonomy-tooltip-34\">investigation</span> concluded there was no indication that any police officers or police staff may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings or committed a criminal offence.

These officers attended and found one of the men on the floor. He told them he had been drinking but was not drunk, that he had arthritis and was in a lot of pain. Bodyworn video (BWV) footage showed the officers helped him to his feet, then spent approximately ten minutes speaking to the other man during which time the first man complained of pain in his neck. The police officers requested an ambulance then subsequently cancelled it and decided to take the injured man to hospital in their police van. The second man was allowed to leave. BWV footage showed the injured man was unable to remain upright after the police officers belted him into a seat in the police van and was unable to walk once they arrived at hospital. Medical records showed he had a fracture in his spinal cord and an epidural haematoma causing paralysis.\\xa0\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'The IOPC recommends that the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) should review the spinal injuries topic within its Emergency Life Support (ELS) training for police officers to ensure that scenarios and examples used do not solely focus on motorcycle accidents and injuries.The IOPC conducted an investigation into allegations that a man with a serious spinal injury was not shown appropriate care and attention by police officers because they did not recognise the extent of his condition, despite it being mentioned (pain in neck, numbness etc) and therefore did not treat man as having a suspected spinal injury. This meant that techniques such as inline immobilisation that they had been trained to undertake were not used. During the investigation, material from the spinal injuries topic of ELS training that all officers undertake on an annual basis was reviewed. This showed that the only scenario used as a teaching tool during training was about how to treat a person involved in a motorcycle accident. If additional examples were given when training officers, their understanding of spinal injuries may increase, along with awareness on when inline immobilisation technique should be used.\\xa0', 'dateofrecommendation': 'Thursday, 19 November, 2020', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '2020-11-19T00:00:00+00:00', 'dateresponsedue': 'Thursday, 14 January, 2021', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '2021-01-14T00:00:00+00:00', 'accepted': 'Yes', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

Where a log has not been created prior to an operation, guidance should state that the Tactical Firearms Commander (TFC)\\xa0should ensure that the tactical plan identifies who will have responsibility for requesting an ambulance directly, to avoid any delay caused by requesting one via the Force Control Room. Where it is reasonable to believe that requesting an ambulance from the scene directly may cause a delay e.g. where phone or radio coverage is poor, a request should be made via the Force Control Room, ensuring that full address details are communicated at the time of making the request.In this case, following shots to a suspect, an ambulance was deployed to an incorrect address, similar in name to the correct address, due to a misunderstanding within the Force Control Room.

There are two separate strands to the complaints made:\\nThe first of these arise from an allegation that the former officer was subjected to bullying and racism whilst posted to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). The former officer reported these matters to senior officers within Cleveland Police in April 2011. In July of 2011, the Cleveland Black Police Association (CBPA) submitted a report to a senior officer within Cleveland Police, highlighting their concerns over potential institutional racism within the force. The report from the CBPA prompted Cleveland Police to commence a process known as the ‘Equality Review’ which ran between 2011 and 2012. This was a fact-finding enquiry which the former officer engaged with and the intention was for it to be a response to the concerns raised by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) officers and staff.\\xa0\\nThe former officer subsequently alleged that the scope of the Equality Review was deliberately changed to hide discrimination within the force and that Cleveland Police’s then Chief Constable misrepresented the review’s findings to the media by failing to disclose information given to the review by BAME officers and claiming there was no institutional racism within Cleveland Police.\\nThe second strand of the former officer’s complaints were made to the IOPC in 2014 when it was\\xa0alleged that, following the complaints of bullying and racism, there was a campaign orchestrated by senior officers within Cleveland Police to undermine and ‘destroy’ the former officer.\\nThe former officer later claimed that Cleveland Police failed to make sufficient efforts to identify a witness who was able to provide evidence to support the claim that there was an organised conspiracy to ‘destroy’ the former officer. It was suggested that this witness could provide evidence of organisational criminality and corruption by the force but this information was supressed by Cleveland Police. \\xa0\\nThe former officer made complaints to Cleveland Police between April and June 2014. They were recorded by the force and voluntarily referred to the IOPC on 26 June 2014. The IOPC passed the referral back to Cleveland Police so that they could be investigated locally. Due to the sensitivities around the allegations and the high potential for a conflict of interests, Cleveland Police asked the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) to conduct the investigation on their behalf. The MPS carried out an investigation (under the operational name of Op Talon), into all the allegations made by the former officer. The MPS investigation commenced in July 2014 and was concluded on 24 June 2016, when they reported they had found no evidence to support the allegations.\\nOn 6 September 2016, the former officer appealed to the IOPC against the findings of the Op Talon investigation. The appeal was partially upheld and the IOPC decided that further additional investigation should be conducted to explore specific areas of the complaints. An IOPC independent investigation began in December 2017.\\nDuring the IOPC investigation, witnesses, who the former officer suggested may be able to assist the investigation, were interviewed and statements obtained. Material gathered by the MPS (Op Talon) investigation has also been examined and considered. The former officer also indicated that evidence presented to named employment tribunals and a Home Affairs Select Committee (HASC) hearing would be relevant to the complaints. This material has also been examined by the IOPC.\\nThe IOPC independent investigation was completed in July 2020. The investigation found that none of the witnesses who were spoken to were able to provide evidence in support of the former officer’s specific complaints. The material gathered by the MPS (Op Talon) was examined and found to be consistent with the findings of that investigation. Material presented to the employment tribunals and the HASC hearing were examined but found not to be evidentially relevant to the complaints.\\nThe IOPC has not upheld the complaints made by the former officer and found no evidence to indicate misconduct or criminality on the part of any of the Cleveland police officers or members of police staff named in the complaints.\\n\\xa0\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Discrimination', 'Cleveland Police']}\n",

One of the cyclists, a black man, was stopped by a police officer who advised him to move back behind the white line. The man and officer engaged in a conversation, in which the man informed the officer he had positioned his bicycle over the white line for his own safety. After a brief conversation, and after traffic began to move on, the officer asked the man to join him on the pavement, where he informed him he would be conducting a stop and search as he had smelt cannabis whilst speaking to him.\\nThe officer later told the IOPC that, as well as smelling cannabis, he had been concerned by the man disagreeing with him over the white line, and thought it may have been a way to distract him from the smell if he was in possession of cannabis. He said he did not tell the man this, however, as he did not want the encounter to escalate.\\nThe man was searched under section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs act by the officer, who patted him down and looked inside a pocket of his jacket. No cannabis was found on him. The encounter was filmed by one of the other people present and shared on social media. The man who had been searched later made a complaint about the encounter, stating that the grounds for the search were not justifiable, and he was racially profiled by the officer. This was because he was concerned that the officer had linked the smell of cannabis to him because he is black.\\nThe IOPC investigated the complaint and examined: the grounds for the search, the way in which it was conducted, and whether the man was treated less favourably by the officer on the basis of his race.\\nOur investigators reviewed the body worn video (BWV) of the encounter, as well as mobile phone footage taken by the other person. We took a statement from all three people, as well as the three officers present. Previous stop and search slips for the officer for a one-year period were also reviewed for comparator evidence.\\nWe concluded our investigation in May 2020, and we partially upheld the complaint. We found that the grounds for the search were not reasonable, as the behavioural ground mentioned did not relate to cannabis, and the use of the smell of cannabis as a single ground is not good practice. This is clearly set out in the College of Policing’s Authorised Professional Practice on stop and search. We recommended that this be addressed by way of reflective practice for the officer, with a focus on what constitutes reasonable grounds, particularly relating to the smell of cannabis.\\nWe did not uphold the complaint in respect of discriminatory behaviour, as a review of the officer’s stop and search slips suggested he used the same grounds to stop and search people of all races, and men and women. This pointed away from discrimination but supported our view that he would benefit from reflective practice as it showed he often uses similar grounds when stopping and searching members of the public.\\nHowever, we did recommend that the officer would benefit from further reflective practice with a focus on the impact of the disproportionate use of stop and search on BAME communities. We recommended this as it appeared the officer did not understand why the man had felt racially profiled by him, despite the assumption that black men smoke cannabis being a well-known public stereotype and the disproportionate use of stop and search on black men being widely known by the public.\\xa0\\nThe Metropolitan Police reviewed our report and agreed with our recommendations. They have confirmed that the officer will receive reflective practice to address the concerns raised, which will involve active engagement from his local stop and search lead in his further learning, including insight on how the MPS are attempting to improve their understanding of the causes of disproportionately in stop and search.\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'The IOPC completed five investigations involving the stop and search of Black men by MPS officers.

The Custody Sergeant assessed his risk as medium upon detention and placed him on 30-minute cell visits and assigned a CCTV monitored cell. A detention officer (DO) searched the man and escorted him to a cell. A DO saw the man in his cell drawing on the walls with his own blood. DOs entered the cell where they found the man to be agitated and to have a deep laceration to his left wrist. Upon further search, a piece of plastic razor blade was\\xa0found. A medical professional treated the man's injury in the cell before officers transported him to hospital.\\n\", 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'The IOPC recommends that Cleveland Police review the working practices used in custody, specifically in relation to CCTV observations, to ensure that the principles set out in\\xa0 the Authorised Professional Practice (APP)\\xa0are followed. This could be reinforced by additional local guidance, training and oversight.APP Level 3 constant observation outlines\\xa0‘If the detainee’s risk assessment indicates a heightened level of risk to the detainee (e.g., self-harm, suicide risk or other significant mental or physical vulnerability) they should be observed at this level.’ Level 3 requires 30 minute checks, and CCTV to be constantly monitored. The custody sergeant who completed a risk assessment said in his statement ‘based on [the detainee’s] demeanour that day alone, I did not feel there was a high risk. However, the information he disclosed about his mental health, self-harm and his warning markers heightened the risk’, therefore he placed the detainee on 30 minute observations and supplemented this with CCTV observation. The evidence suggests that the custody sergeant’s risk assessment of the detainee matched the criteria for APP level 3 observations, as a heightened risk due to self-harm and mental health. The custody sergeant clarified that the CCTV observation used was not constant and a detention officer (DO) may be monitoring up to 12 CCTV feeds ‘when they can’ while simultaneously carrying out other back office duties. He added ‘constant observation is only done for extreme risk of self-harm, epilepsy, withdrawal from alcohol or concealed drugs.’ Other Middlesbrough custody staff, including detention officers and a different custody sergeant, confirmed the same practice in their statements. There has also been another similar DSI in the same custody suite where CCTV observations were raised as an issue.\\xa0On that basis\\xa0the evidence suggests this deviation from APP levels of observation is a normal working practice in Middlesbrough custody. The CCTV shows that the detainee was drawing on the walls of his cell in blood for 6 minutes before a DO became aware during a regular 30 minute cell check. The evidence suggests the CCTV was not closely monitored and the level of CCTV observation used was not in line with APP level 3.', 'dateofrecommendation': 'Wednesday, 17 June, 2020', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '2020-06-17T00:00:00+01:00', 'dateresponsedue': 'Wednesday, 12 August, 2020', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '2020-08-12T00:00:00+01:00', 'accepted': 'Yes', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Death and serious injury', 'Cleveland Police']}\n",

The officers almost immediately re-sighted the car and continued to pursue it for a further minute. They again aborted the pursuit on sighting a young boy who had been knocked off his bicycle by the pursued car which failed to stop following the collision.\\nThe boy received an injury to his knee and wrist and the officers attended to him, providing first aid assistance and requesting the attendance of an ambulance.\\nWe obtained accounts from the police officers and examined the police in-car footage which recorded the entirety of the pursuit.

Officers arrived, began talking to her and requested a negotiator. While officers were trying to engage with her, the woman lowered herself over the ledge of the bridge and dangled precariously from a railing.

Based on the evidence, he spoke to her with considerable empathy and put any concerns for his own safety to one side in an attempt to keep the woman from harm. He can be heard on body-worn video encouraging the woman to climb back to safety, and was visibly distressed after she slipped from his grasp. Police officers involved followed procedures and policies by approaching the scene silently, and blocking off the road and footpath beneath the bridge to prevent members of the public accessing the area.\\nWe concluded our investigation in February 2020.

Officers visited her at her home and established there was a domestic dispute between the woman and her parents, linked to her mental health and drug and alcohol abuse.

They took the woman to hospital, where a doctor assessed her and authorised her discharge the same day. The police officers then took her to a custody suite, where the woman continued to be violent and attempted to self-harm. The officers used further force to restrain her during her time in custody. She was charged with offences and taken to court the following morning. Following her admission to prison, authorities there questioned the length of time the woman was kept restrained while in police custody.\\nFollowing a referral from the force, we began an investigation and examined Humberside Police records, custody CCTV and body-worn video footage relevant to the woman’s police detention. We conducted witness interviews with several officers and staff involved in the woman’s arrest and detention and examined their interactions with the woman, with particular focus on the risks associated with her, her care, and the use of force.\\nDuring our investigation, we identified an initial indication of alleged misconduct on the part of a custody officer over use of force and their recording of it, and their decision making in relation to the woman’s period in custody. This officer retired from Humberside Police during our investigation, however, they cooperated fully and provided a detailed account of their decision making and rationale.\\nAt the end of our investigation we concluded that overall in our opinion, the officers exercised sound judgement in determining the level of force required and the frequency of its use.\\nThe officers who conducted cell watch duties appeared to have considered the woman’s and their own safety to be a priority and made efforts to engage with her in an empathetic and professional manner.\\nIn respect of the one specific custody officer, we concluded that, had they still been serving, they would have had no case to answer for misconduct, but failings identified would have been suitably addressed by management action.\\nWe completed our investigation in March 2020.

On encountering the man, officers shouted clear instructions to the man to drop his gun. The man moved towards the officers and aimed his handgun at one of them. The officer fired two shots at the man, one of which struck him in the chest. Officers provided first aid, and the man was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery for a serious but non-fatal injury. The man subsequently recovered, and later admitted possessing an imitation handgun and was sentenced for firearms offences.\\nFollowing a mandatory referral from Humberside Police, we carried out an independent investigation into the non-fatal police shooting. IOPC investigators obtained and reviewed council CCTV and officers’ body-worn video footage. We also analysed the force’s incident log, and radio and telephone communications. We considered witness statements from the officers and staff involved, the man who was shot, and others. We reviewed other relevant documentation from Humberside Police including force policies, and obtained a report from a firearms instructor expert. We produced a compilation of visual footage and audio recordings to provide a real-time portrayal of events from the 999 call through to the rendering of first aid after the shooting.\\nWe were of the opinion the police decision-making in responding to a man reported walking in a public area carrying what was believed to be a viable firearm was appropriate. It was necessary and proportionate for armed officers to deliver a tactical challenge from the cover of their police vehicles, and for an officer to discharge their firearm. It was regrettable the man chose not to comply with clear and unambiguous instructions to drop his weapon. In our view the actions of the officers involved were in line with force and national policies on firearms deployment, and they deserved credit for their professional handling of a highly threatening situation to safeguard themselves and the public. The officer who fired showed considerable empathy towards the man immediately afterwards when treating his injuries.\\nDuring the investigation there was no indication any police officer may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings or committed a criminal offence.\\nWe concluded our investigation in March 2020.

The former MP stated WYP’s alleged failure to investigate these reports resulted in continued harassment, which caused them, and their staff, to fear for their personal safety. The former MP also made three separate reports to WYP in relation to swastikas being left at their constituency office. The former MP alleged WYP failed to effectively investigate these reports. Finally, the former MP alleged that WYP failed to support them, as a victim, and failed to keep them regularly updated in relation to the progress of its investigations.\\nDuring our investigation, the Investigator obtained a volume of documentary evidence including occurrence details logs, incident logs and email correspondence. The investigator also obtained detailed accounts from the officers who were involved in progressing the former MP’s reports, specifically in relation to their decisions and actions. The Investigator compared the actions of WYP with the relevant policies and procedures.\\nAlthough the former MP initially engaged with the investigation, they ceased to respond to the Investigator’s requests for information. The Investigator therefore concluded the investigation based on the evidence available to them.\\nIn relation to the former MP’s report in 2018, the evidence indicated WYP appropriately assessed the occurrence type as nuisance telephone calls/texts/emails. Officers carefully considered the context in which some social media posts were written and assessed they were not a threat. We were of the view this was a reasonable conclusion to have reached, based on the information available. Evidence also showed that officers demonstrated a good grasp of the force’s Stalking and Harassment Policy. Regarding a second report made in 2018, a member of the public was served with a harassment notice as they continued to post comments regarding the former MP after being warned of the negative impact their comments had on them. We assessed this action was also in keeping with the force’s policy. We found no evidence to support the former MP’s allegation that WYP failed to complete a timely and effective investigation into their reports and did not uphold that complaint.\\nIn our opinion, there was a volume of documentary evidence to indicate that WYP progressed all three investigations into reports of swastikas being left outside the former MP’s constituency office, and this within a responsible and appropriate timeframe. This took into account the apparent difficulties the force experienced in identifying the suspect. We did not uphold this complaint.\\nWe also investigated the complaint that WYP failed to fulfil its obligations under the Victims’ Code when interacting with the former MP. In our opinion, the evidence indicated WYP did contact the complainant regularly to update them or their staff on the progress of their investigations. According to the information recorded on WYP systems, the longest period of time which elapsed between updates appeared to be three weeks, with the exception of the last update, which was 12 weeks. Although the Victims’ Code does not specify the frequency of updates to victims, a period of 12 weeks between updates does, in our opinion, appear unreasonable. This is especially in view of the fact that WYP was in possession of information they could have shared with the former MP (the arrest of a suspect). We therefore decided to partially uphold this complaint.\\nWe completed our investigation in December 2019.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['West Yorkshire Police']}\n",

The officer began to follow the Mazda and then used the police vehicle emergency lights in a further attempt to get the driver’s attention. The Mazda began to increase its speed and the police vehicle momentarily did the same before the police driver called the pursuit off, as he considered it too dangerous to continue. The officer decreased his speed and turned off his emergency equipment. The officer also passed a message over his radio to the Control Room giving a partial registration of the vehicle and advising that he was calling off his pursuit. As the Mazda continued up the road it reached a peak speed of between 75 and 86mph before colliding with a stationary car waiting to turn right off the road. The driver of the Mazda lost control and the vehicle crashed into a stone building. The front-seat passenger was pronounced dead at the scene. The rear-seat passenger had serious injuries and the driver sustained minor injuries. The driver was arrested later that day on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.\\nOur investigators attended the scene and the post-incident procedure. We obtained a detailed account from the officer involved, along with a copy of the transcript of the police interview with the driver of the Mazda. We examined CCTV footage and transcriptions of the radio transmissions between the officer and the control room. We reviewed data recorded by the police vehicle as well as the collision investigation report, together with local and national policies and guidance.\\nThe activation of the police vehicle emergency equipment appeared to have influenced the way the driver of the Mazda was driving, however, it was not possible to state whether the collision would have been avoided had the officer not activated his emergency equipment. Evidence showed that the driver of the Mazda was driving at speed before then.\\nThe officer explained his decision making around initiating a pursuit and his decision to almost immediately abandon the pursuit. The police vehicle reached a peak speed of 65mph which was momentary before the vehicle began to brake and reduce its speed. There is no evidence to suggest that the officer acted in a manner that was outside of his driver training, or contrary to professional practice or the force’s vehicle pursuit policy.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe completed our investigation in May 2019 but waited until we received confirmation in early 2020 that the inquest into the death of the Mazda’s passenger would not resume before publishing its outcomes.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Road traffic incidents', 'Lancashire Constabulary']}\n",

The incident had escalated from an ongoing neighbour dispute, and attempts by police at serving a harassment warning on the complainant resulted in the subsequent arrest of the man and woman.\\nThe man complained that officers were not fair in serving him and the woman with a harassment warning, that officers had assaulted both (resulting in the woman sustaining a fractured ankle), and that the woman was discriminated in custody about her ethnicity.\\xa0 The man further alleged that officers lied in their statements, and disclosed information to residents about the police case against him.\\nIn October 2015 the complainant and the woman both pleaded guilty to obstructing and assaulting police.\\nMerseyside Police carried out a local investigation, which they concluded in November 2017, upholding some aspects of the complaint. As a result, eight officers received management action by way of advice.\\nIn December 2017 the complainant appealed against the outcome of the local investigation. In April 2018 we upheld his appeal and decided we would carry out an independent investigation. Initially the upheld appeal determined that we would re-investigate all aspects of the original complaint. However, it was later agreed with the complainant that we would focus on aspects of his complaint he felt were unsatisfactorily dealt with by Merseyside Police.\\nOur investigators obtained all the original material generated by Merseyside Police during their investigation, including the investigation report. We analysed this, alongside statements, policies and procedures, and body-worn camera footage taken from the incident. We obtained further accounts and documentation where any gaps remained from Merseyside Police’s original investigation report, and analysed these together with the original material.\\nWe investigated the advice a Merseyside Police community support officer (PCSO) gave to the complainant and the decision made by officers to serve him with a harassment warning. We did not uphold this complaint. Based on the evidence we considered there was more evidence than not that the actions of officers and the PCSO were in line with the applicable policies and procedures in relation to the issuing of the harassment warning and that there were no conduct, performance or learning matters to address.\\nWe also investigated an allegation that officers used excessive force and assaulted the complainant on 27 March 2015. In our view, the evidence supported that officers had an honestly held belief that force was necessary to reduce the threat posed by the complainant. It was our opinion that there was insufficient evidence that the officers’ use of force was unlawful and so this part of the complaint was not upheld.\\nWe also investigated a complaint that officers conducted a search of the complainant’s home address unlawfully, which resulted in the unlawful seizure of a mobile phone\\nAfter the complainant was arrested, one of the officers went into his home to retrieve the other officer’s handcuffs and their paperwork, which the woman had taken. In our view, the officer did not have consent from the complainant to do this, and appeared to misunderstand their powers under Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). In our opinion there was insufficient evidence that any reasonable panel, properly directed, could find misconduct for the officer. We recommended that a learning outcome, via management action, would be most appropriate to address this. We upheld this part of the complaint.\\nThe other officer seized the woman’s daughter’s mobile phone, in order to prevent the evidence being deleted, lost or damaged. The officer did not have the legal power to be on the premises and therefore could not seize the phone under PACE, without consent. In our opinion, there was insufficient evidence that any reasonable panel, properly directed, could find misconduct for the second officer, and that a learning outcome, via management action, would be most appropriate to address the area highlighted. We also upheld this part of the complaint.\\nWe did not uphold a complaint that one of the custody sergeants refused to accept the woman’s self-defined ethnicity and was racially prejudiced, due to lack of evidence.\\nWe investigated an allegation that officers did not request a PIN from the woman’s daughter for her mobile phone, resulting in the loss of potential evidence. We found insufficient evidence and did not uphold the complaint.\\nThe evidence indicated that Merseyside Police failed to secure the custody CCTV footage and we upheld this complaint. We were of the view that the officer who failed to secure the footage made a mistake and that this could be appropriately dealt with by way of learning, via management action.\\nWe found insufficient evidence to support the complainant’s allegation that Merseyside Police inappropriately disclosed information about the case to his neighbours.

The pursuit lasted for approximately ten minutes and ended when the woman’s vehicle crashed into a tree. The woman sustained fractures to metatarsals in her right foot.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators spoke with the TVP driving school, reviewed the relevant local and national policies, as well as the officer’s driver training history, and obtained several accounts from the officer involved and an account from the woman whose car crashed.\\nOur investigation found that the officer had transferred to TVP from another force. His training records indicated he had undertaken standard-response and initial-phase pursuit (IPP) training in November 2014. After joining TVP in September 2018, the officer undertook a transferee assessment with a TVP trainer, as a result of which he was authorised as a standard response driver, subject to a maximum speed of 20mph\\xa0over the posted limit,\\xa0and was not authorised to pursue vehicles. The officer signed an acknowledgement accepting this, and it was also recommended that he should attend an IPP course to update his knowledge of TVP policy and procedures. The officer’s IPP qualification was removed from his records in October 2018.\\nEvidence indicated that, having received and acknowledged specific instructions about not being able to conduct a pursuit, he then received a permit that pre-dated his assessment, but contained IPP authorisation. It would appear from the evidence that the TVP driver training school may have contributed to any confusion the driver may have had as to whether he was authorised to conduct pursuits. However, the TVP Driver Policy states that it is the driver’s responsibility to ensure they are authorised and hold a valid TVP driving permit.\\nWe considered that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed could find misconduct in relation to the driver holding an invalid TVP permit. However, we were of the view that the officer’s performance had fallen below what could have been expected of him and suggested he would benefit from management action.\\nTVP policy stipulates that standard-response drivers are not permitted to drive at more than 20mph above the designated speed limit. Analysis of the police vehicle suggested the officer was driving in excess of this at various points during the pursuit. We were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could conclude that to conduct a pursuit over approximately 14 miles, with a duration of approximately 10 minutes, was in itself, inappropriate. The officer also stated that he was fully aware of the guidance regarding the 20mph rule, but continued his pursuit regardless. We were therefore of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed could find misconduct.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe completed our investigation in October 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, TVP agreed that the officer had a case to answer for misconduct, and proposed to deal with this with management action, in the form of a debrief meeting between the officer and the Head of TVP’s Department of Professional Standards to discuss the officer’s driving and understanding of the policy, and to learn from the incident.\\nWe agreed that their proposal was appropriate.\\nAs part of our investigation, we also identified some areas of learning for the force (see below).\\nTVP arrested the woman in May 2019 for a number of driving offences arising out of this incident. She subsequently pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and other related offences and was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment and banned from driving for two years.\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'The IOPC recommends that Thames Valley Police (TVP)\\xa0makes sure that all relevant checks are carried out before officers who have transferred from another force are authorised to drive with Thames Valley Police. This should include ensuring that officers meet any requirements under force policy, including requirements regarding recent operational driving experience.\\xa0This follows a case where an officer re-joined TVP from another force and was involved in a pursuit when they were not authorised to do so under TVP policy.\\xa0Our investigation found when the officer provided their driver training records from the previous force, the same authorisations were added to the officer’s Thames Valley Police driving record.\\xa0 Thames Valley Police driving school subsequently established that the officer had not driven operationally for over 12 months.', 'dateofrecommendation': 'Thursday, 20 February, 2020', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '2020-02-20T00:00:00+00:00', 'dateresponsedue': 'Thursday, 16 April, 2020', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '2020-04-16T00:00:00+01:00', 'accepted': 'Yes', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Road traffic incidents', 'Thames Valley Police']}\n",

However, neither officer saw the first vehicle again and the second, later identified as an Audi, was never close enough to the police vehicle for them to obtain further details. The officers followed the vehicle for approximately one minute in total. Having witnessed the vehicle negotiate a roundabout the wrong way, coupled with a change in the driving environment, the driver decided to turn off the sirens and lights. The police officers then discovered a vehicle (which was the same vehicle they had followed), an Audi, had collided with a lamp-post and a tree.

The driver of the car was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. The passenger of the car and the police officer both died at the scene following the collision.\\nWe investigated the planning and preparation of the training exercise and how the training exercise was carried out, including any associated risk assessments. We also looked at how the TVP motorcycle rider was driving and whether this may have contributed to the collision.\\nOur investigators attended the scene. We gathered over 43 witness statements from police officers, HMRC officers and members of the public. We also reviewed relevant legislation and policies, as well as the police motorcyclist’s training and disciplinary record. We also reviewed and analysed briefings of the training exercise, and its deployment.\\nA separate criminal investigation was also conducted into the actions of the driver of the car which the police motorcyclist collided with. The investigation focused on the driver’s actions, and whether these contributed to the death of both the car’s passenger and the police motorcyclist. A report carried out into the circumstances of the collision mentioned that the police motorcyclist was wearing dark clothing (which was in accordance with his covert surveillance role) and his headlight was not on.\\nThe evidence indicated the police motorcyclist went over the speed limit when he approached the junction where the collision occurred – which was not contrary to the legislation in place at the time of the training, and fitted within the role and purpose of a surveillance motorcyclist. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that his actions were not proportionate to the circumstances.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police or with HMRC may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nOur investigation identified some learning for TVP and HMRC arising from this case. Evidence indicated that HMRC and TVP’s understanding that TVP surveillance officers were exempt from driving at local speed limits and could use speed exemptions was inconsistent across all those who were involved in the training. We also suggested that both TVP and HMRC could consider making a joint risk assessment before such training exercises.\\nBoth TVP and HMRC agreed to take part in a joint learning debrief to identify and address learning opportunities arising from the incident.\\nWe completed our investigation in November 2018 but waited until criminal proceedings against the driver of the car had completed, in early 2020, to publish its outcomes. The driver was acquitted of two counts of death by careless driving following a trial early in 2020.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Road traffic incidents', \"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\", 'Thames Valley Police']}\n",

They placed two women in handcuffs and put them in the back of their police car. They then pursued a robbery suspect, with the women in the back of the car, and then stopped the car, as the women were arguing. They took one of the women out of the car and removed her handcuffs. At approximately midnight the officers set off in the police car, leaving the woman at the side of the road, and her wife still inside the car.\\nAccording to the officers, the woman in the police car lunged towards them. They stopped the car and removed her from the back seat. One of the officers took her to the ground using a leg sweep and restrained her there, using his left hand to restrain her head. At some point during the restraint, the woman sustained injuries to her face, which later required stitches. The other officer sat on her legs and the woman accused him of using homophobic language. The officers called for assistance and two more officers transported her to the local custody suite, where she was detained and questioned for the offence of assaulting a police officer.\\nBoth women later complained to WYP, who conducted two local investigations into the matters. The women appealed the outcome. We upheld their appeal and on 27 April 2018, and determined it should be independently re-investigated by us.\\nOur investigators obtained copies of all the documents collated during the previous investigations into the matter and reviewed them.

In addition, they spoke to a range of witnesses, obtained detailed accounts from each of the two women, interviewed the two officers and took witness statements from the other officers involved in this incident.\\nAt the conclusion of the investigation we believed the evidence indicated that the two officers had a case to answer for gross misconduct. We also referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), who considered an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The CPS declined to prosecute either officer as they did not consider there to be a realistic prospect of conviction. We completed our investigation in June 2019.\\nWe shared our report with WYP, who believed a case to answer for misconduct rather than gross misconduct was appropriate. We considered the force’s rationale for this opinion and agreed that the officers should attend a misconduct meeting for the following alleged breaches of the Standards of Professional Behaviour:\\nThe two officers attended a misconduct meeting in January 2020, where a finding of misconduct was determined for both of them.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Discrimination', 'Use of force and armed policing', 'West Yorkshire Police']}\n",

The woman’s friends had informed the team that she had been texting about wanting to commit suicide at home by overdosing on her medication. The incident was graded as urgent. Two officers were sent to the woman’s flat, where they heard, and observed through a window, a woman heavily asleep and snoring loudly. The officers were unable to wake the woman despite repeatedly banding on the window. Although they could not see her face, they believed this to be the woman in question. After checking with their supervisor, the officers left her home with the intention to return later.\\nWhen the officers returned around three hours later, they could no longer hear snoring and decided it was appropriate to force entry, as there was a risk to life. The officers did not have method of entry equipment with them and had to return to their local station, where it took the officers around 45 minutes to locate an enforcer. Upon return to the woman’s home, the officers had initial difficulty breaking through the front door but eventually made entry and found the woman dead.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the officers and assessed their actions and decisions regarding the woman. Three police officers and two members of police staff were served with notices informing them that their conduct was under investigation as having potentially breached the standards of professional behaviour.\\nInvestigators also interviewed witnesses to the incident. They analysed radio communication between force control room staff and officers involved in the incident.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the two officers who went to the woman’s flat may have a case to answer for misconduct for not forcing entry when their first attended and, on the second occasion, as soon as they arrived. We were also of the opinion that the officers’ supervisor may also have a case to answer for misconduct for failing to identify that the potential risk to the woman had not been mitigated when he agreed with the officers to not use their powers to force entry on their first visit, and for failing to prompt the officers to ensure they were properly equipped to force entry should the circumstances have changed when they went back.\\nWe found that the two members of staff had correctly graded the incident in line with TVP policy.\\nAfter reviewing our report, TVP agreed with our findings. One of the two officers who attended the woman’s flat received management action after a misconduct meeting, as did the supervisor. The second officer had left the force and therefore no further action could be taken.\\nWe completed our investigation in August 2018 but waited until the inquest into the woman’s death had concluded, in early 2020, before publishing its outcome.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Thames Valley Police']}\n",

He had recently experienced mental health issues and episodes of paranoia, and had been taking cocaine. That evening, the man took a significant amount of cocaine and produced a large knife. He then jumped or fell out of his friend’s bedroom window into the street below.\\nShortly afterwards, Devon and Cornwall Police received reports that the man had stabbed a woman in the leg with a large kitchen knife, causing her superficial injuries. The man was reported to be walking down the street armed with the knife. When officers arrived on the scene, they observed that the man was harming himself by cutting his neck with the knife. An officer made the decision to approach him and ask him to drop the knife. When the man did not comply, the officer Tasered him three times in order to try to disarm him. The man was incapacitated by Taser but did not drop the knife, so another officer struck the man’s wrist with a baton and successfully disarmed him.\\nA member of the public, who identified himself as the man’s brother, approached officers and told them that the man had taken cocaine and been experiencing mental health issues.\\nThe man soon became unresponsive and officers performed first aid on him until paramedics attended the scene. He was taken to hospital but died later that evening.\\nA post-mortem examination found that the man had died of a multiple causes, including the use of cocaine, an episode of altered behaviour including self-harm, excitement, exertion, and restraint including the discharge of a Taser.\\nOur investigators attended the scene the day after the incident, where they took statements from witnesses and the man’s family and friends. We also attended the post-mortem examination and arranged for further medical tests to be carried out to establish the cause of the man’s death. We obtained witness accounts from the officers and paramedics who had attended the scene, and established the policies and procedures used by Devon and Cornwall Police in relation to Taser.\\nThe evidence suggested that officers acted in accordance with legislation, national and local policies, and local training procedures when using force, specifically Taser, against the man. We also found that the officer who Tasered the man had acted in accordance with a training scenario in which officers were taught to use an extended Taser cycle to ensure someone self-harming with a knife was safely disarmed.\\nAt the end of the investigation, based on the evidence available, we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have committed a criminal offence or behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings.\\nWe completed our investigation in December 2017 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded, in early 2020, to publish its outcome.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Use of force and armed policing', 'Devon and Cornwall Constabulary']}\n",

During the incident, a physical altercation ensued between the man and WMP officers after he had been placed in the police car. One deployed incapacitant spray, which appeared to have little effect. The other officer deployed his Taser.\\nWMP referred this incident to us in August 2018 to investigate the conduct of both officers.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed the officers, obtained statements from several witnesses and reviewed the officers’ body-worn video (BWV) footage. Investigators also reviewed audible airwave transmissions from the incident and conducted a house-to-house enquiry in the vicinity of the incident location.\\nThe evidence appeared to support the officers’ accounts that the man became aggressive in the rear of the police vehicle. The BWV footage showed the man behave aggressively and move quickly towards the car door, where the physical altercation with officers commenced. Evidence showed that, following the use of incapacitant spray, the man was in a restraint position on the ground.\\nWhile the man was on the ground, BWV captured one officer saying “you know what, fuck it” before deploying his Taser. The officer later explained his justification for using Taser was to gain complete control of the man, and that the words he used reflected his frustration at having to escalate and do something he didn’t want to do. We were of the view that the officer had not given due consideration to the fact that additional officers were mere seconds away from arriving when he deployed his Taser. We were also of the opinion that the officer’s justification for the use of Taser was insufficient.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that a tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for the officer who deployed his Taser for breach of the Authority, Respect and Courtesy and the Use of Force standards of professional behaviour. In respect of the officer who deployed his incapacitant spray, the investigation concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct. We concluded our investigation in October 2018.\\nThe officer who deployed his Taser attended a gross misconduct hearing in autumn 2019. The panel could find no reason to doubt the evidence provided by the officer, and found that he had had an honestly held belief, at the time he used his Taser, that his safety and the safety of others were in danger, and that it had been necessary for him to deploy his Taser. Regarding the officer’s use of words, the panel found this was a comment that did not reflect a lack of self-control and did not discredit police service or undermine confidence in policing.

They had been provided with intelligence that the man had been seen doing what looked like drug dealing. The officers attempted to restrain the man within seconds of speaking to him, and without explaining what they were stopping him for. He resisted their restraint, and repeatedly asked what he had done wrong. Without providing an explanation, the officers attempted to handcuff him, and one of the officers deployed their incapacitant spray. Once detained, the man was searched for drugs, and given the reason for the stop and search. Officers did not find any drugs on him and released him.\\nThe force referred the incident to us as a conduct matter. Our investigation examined: the way in which the stop and search was conducted and whether it was fair and effective; the force used on the man and whether it was necessary, proportionate and reasonable; and whether the man was treated less favourably by the officers on the basis of his race. \\xa0\\nOur investigators took a statement from the man and from a police community support officer who was present at the time, and reviewed body-worn video footage of the incident.

We were also of the view that, although there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the man was treated differently on the basis of his race, there was an opportunity for learning for both officers, as they appeared to be lacking an understanding as to why their actions could have been perceived to be discriminatory.\\nWe completed our investigation in August 2019.\\nBedfordshire Police reviewed our report and agreed. They also determined that the second officer had a case to answer for misconduct for the poor aftercare the man was given after the use of incapacitant spray. We agreed with their determinations.

Two police units responded to the last known location of the stolen van. At 5.18pm, the van was reported as driving in convoy with another vehicle. However, the driver of one of the police vehicles did not have the required training for a pursuit, and therefore could not follow the stolen van. The driver of the second police vehicle, an armed response vehicle (ARV), had the required training to continue following the van while seeking an opportunity to stop and make an arrest. The ARV drove down the high street towards the stolen van. After unsuccessfully trying to block off the van’s route at a mini roundabout, the ARV pursued the stolen vehicle into a residential area. The driver of the stolen van collided with a brick wall and got out of the vehicle. He was struck by the ARV, lifted off his feet and thrown forward by the velocity of the impact into the front garden of a house. He sustained a dislocated hip as a result and was taken to hospital for treatment\\nCambridgeshire Constabulary referred this incident to us in November 2018 as a Death or Serious Injury referral. In the course of reviewing dash-camera footage and the independent data download from the car, we found indications that the driver of the police ARV may have breached section 1a of the Road Traffic Act. We served the police driver with a notice and a criminal letter.\\nDuring our investigation, we secured the police vehicle independent data download and analysed a report. Our investigation confirmed the speeds and contacts between a stolen van and a police vehicle. We also assessed body-worn video footage. Our investigators took statements from key police witnesses. We interviewed the police driver under criminal caution. He provided an account and rationale for his decision making.\\nThe police driver stated that going alongside the van was a deliberate action on his part to try and keep the man in the van. We accepted that, while the tactic was unsuccessful, there was no evidence of malicious intent on the police driver’s behalf to injure the man.\\nNotwithstanding the legitimate policing purpose of the pursuit, and that the man got out of the van and into the path of the ARV, this was a serious collision with a person, with serious injuries, and which reports suggest could have been avoided. Specialist reports have raised questions about the manner of the pursuit and about the choice of tactics, both of which appear to have increased risk. For these reasons we were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find that the police driver had breached the standards of professional behaviour in relation to duties and responsibilities. We were of the view that this may constitute misconduct, but did not require attendance at a misconduct meeting. We completed our investigation in September 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report Cambridgeshire Constabulary agreed. The force advised that the police driver would receive management action. This will include a directed reflection meeting with the Head of the Driving School to explore the police driver’s actions, decisions and risk assessment. The officer will also undertake remedial refresher training, particularly in regard to the assessment of risk in dynamic circumstances associated with pursuit driving and tactics, and any other refresher training recommended by the Head of the Driving school.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Cambridgeshire Constabulary']}\n",

It stated that the Captain of the Guard wished for the officer to stop “talking and flirting” with his guards or face a formal complaint. The letter was on paper intended to imitate Household Division letter-headed paper. Although the letter did not explicitly mention any officer, it was understood to have been directed at an openly gay officer (officer C). Managers initially dealt with the letter via informal management advice before an Inspector returned from leave and escalated the incident.\\nOur investigation looked at whether the actions of officers A and B in using MPS computers, while on duty, to create and post the letter a Household Division headed letter purporting to be from the Captain of the Guard breached the police standards of professional behaviour. It also reviewed managers’ investigation of the incident and examined whether officers A and B’s actions may have amounted to discrimination.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained the letter, interviewed officers involved, reviewed emails sent following the incident and CCTV footage, obtained copies of text and WhatsApp messages as well as statements from several witnesses. We also reviewed relevant legislation, policies and procedures.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed could find, on the balance of probabilities that officer A created the notice on a police computer and posted it in a rest room frequented by police officers, constituting misuse of a police computer. Officer C suffered distress as a result, although there was nothing to suggest that this was the wilful intention of officer A, who posted the letter. There appeared to be no evidence to suggest that officer A was responsible for the wider circulation of the letter on social media. We considered that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for officer A, and suggested this could be proportionately dealt with by way of management action.\\nWe were of the view that officer B’s involvement in this incident was minimal. Officer B apologised to officer C. We were of the view that officer B’s actions did not constitute misconduct, but that officer B would still benefit from management action.\\nWe carefully considered whether there were any learning opportunities arising from the investigation. We make learning recommendations to improve policing and public confidence in the police complaints system, and prevent a recurrence of similar incidents. In this case, the investigation did not identify any learning.\\nWe completed our investigation in April 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report the MPS determined that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for officer A. Therefore there was a case to answer for officer A with regard to creating a fake letter of complaint on MPS systems, posting the letter on a noticeboard and acting in a discriminatory manner toward officer C due to his sexual orientation. The force was of the opinion that officer A should attend a misconduct meeting for breaches of the following professional standards: Equality and Diversity; Authority Respect and Courtesy; and Orders and Instructions.\\nThe MPS agreed that officer B would receive management action.\\nOfficer A attended a misconduct meeting in autumn 2019, at which misconduct was proven on two counts: breaches of the Authority, Respect and Courtesy standard of professional behaviour, and of the Orders and Instructions standard of professional behaviour. Misconduct was not proven for a breach of the Equality and Diversity standard of professional behaviour.

He resisted restraint, and officers used their batons to get him to comply, including striking him on the head. The man was then arrested for multiple assaults on emergency workers.

A woman reported that her partner had damaged property in the home. The police officers separated the man and her partner upon arrival and obtained information from them both about the allegations. The woman was told by one of the officers that no offences had been committed by her partner and he was advised to leave the property. Prior to his departure, the man was recorded on body-worn video (BWV) to ask the same officer for cannabis. The officer was heard on the footage asking the woman for cannabis and on departure from the property, the man was heard to thank the officer. A few hours later, the woman made a further call to Essex Police to express her confusion about the information she had been given by the attending officers. Later that morning the two officers returned to the woman’s home and recorded an offence of criminal damage.\\nEssex Police referred this incident to us as a conduct referral.\\nDuring our investigation, investigators interviewed the police constable and obtained a witness statement from the second attending officer, force control room staff and the acting police sergeant who was on duty at the time. We listened to the calls made by the woman and reviewed the officers’ actions against Essex Police policies and procedures.\\nDuring interview with our investigators the officer admitted knowingly giving a quantity of cannabis to a member of the public during his attendance at the property. The events surrounding this were captured to some degree on BWV.\\nOur investigation also revealed evidence in relation to how the two police officers who attended the domestic abuse incident had dealt with the allegations made by the woman and how they had responded to the allegations that her partner had damaged her property.\\nWe were of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for one of the officers regarding their decision not to arrest the man and not safeguarding the woman and her children. However, we were of the view that there appeared to be areas of the officer’s performance that required improvement. We therefore suggested these would be best addressed by management action.\\nWe were also of the view that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed could find that supplying the man with the drugs was a serious error of judgement, and that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for the officer for handing the man the cannabis. However, we considered the mitigating circumstances – this was a single incident of brief duration, the officer admitted what they did and stated they would not deal with a similar situation in the same way. Therefore, we considered this could be appropriately handled by management action.\\nWe also recommended that the performance of the other attending officer in some areas also needed addressing.\\nWe completed our investigation in September 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Essex Police agreed that both officers would receive management action in the form of a debrief, additional training in respect of the law surrounding Criminal Damage, and having full understanding of a number of relevant Essex Police Procedures.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Essex Police']}\n",

The man was searched and arrested by British Transport Police (BTP) officers, who transported him to a GMP custody suite. The man was then searched again at custody by a BTP officer and then booked in to custody by GMP. He remained in custody overnight, where he was visited on numerous occasions and roused regularly during that time.\\nThe following morning, at approximately 8.56am, an inspector completing a review identified that the man was unresponsive in the cell. A search of the man’s cell revealed a substance believed to be spice (a synthetic form of cannabis) in the cell. A healthcare professional (HCP) was asked to attend and the man was provided with first aid before being taken to hospital, where he made a full recovery.\\nDuring the investigation, we reviewed the incident logs, CCTV, the man’s custody record and local/national policy. We also obtained statements given by the attending officers.\\xa0\\nEvidence indicated that the search conducted on the man appears to have been thorough.

During this incident, MPS officers forced entry into the man’s flat. Several of the officers used force when they attempted to restrain and arrest the man. Two of the officers used their Taser devices and one of the Taser-trained officers struck the man three times in the face with the hand in which he was holding his Taser.\\nThis first came to the attention of the MPS on 24 August 2018 when the man’s solicitor placed a civil claim to the MPS.

The evidence also suggests that the man was aggressively resisting following the apparent failure of Taser to subdue him. The officer who struck the man in the face while holding their Taser provided an explanation for their actions. The evidence appears to suggest the man was aggressive, violent, suffering from mental health issues, intoxicated either by drugs and/or alcohol, and had a screwdriver and crack pipe in close proximity that could be used as weapons.\\nWe were therefore of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed could find misconduct for either officer for excessive use of force.\\xa0 We found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.

She reported that her husband had sent her a text message\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 saying that he intended to take his own life. The man was initially treated as a ‘medium risk’ missing person, but this was later escalated to ‘high risk’. Officers located the man in the early hours of the following morning and detained him under section 136 of the Mental Health Act. He was discharged from hospital the following day.\\nOn 29 April 2018, the man went missing for a second time. His wife contacted Devon and Cornwall Police at 5.55pm and reported that he had left the house at approximately 10am that morning, saying he was going to get milk at a nearby supermarket, but had not returned. She added that it was possible that he may be in one of the local pubs. The man was risk-assessed as a ‘medium risk’ missing person. Officers completed a search at his home address and enquiries with local pubs. A police dog unit was also asked to walk the route that the man would have taken to the supermarket, but the man was not found.\\nAt 1.55am on 30 April 2018, after officers had established through viewing CCTV that the man had not been to the supermarket, the risk assessment was increased to ‘high risk’ and officers again searched for the man. Officers found him hanging in a dense area of woodland at 8.36am on 30 April 2018.\\nWe investigated the contact that the man had had with Devon and Cornwall Police before his death. We also investigated one complaint made by the man’s wife that he should have been escalated to ‘high risk’ earlier in the missing person investigation of 29 and 30 April.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators reviewed the police incident logs relating to both reports that the man had gone missing. We obtained witness statements from a number of the officers involved in dealing with the report of 29 April 2018. We also reviewed local and national policies and guidance regarding missing person’s investigations.\\nWe were of the view that officers had carefully considered the circumstances and recorded detailed and reasoned decisions on the incident log. They took into account that, when he had gone missing on 18 April, the man had sent a text implying that he intended to end his life, but had not done so that time, and had also said he would not put his wife “through this again”. It was therefore our opinion that the initial risk assessment on 29 April 2018 and the later reviews prior to 1.55am, which assessed him as ‘medium risk’ were reasonable in light of the information available at the time.\\nIn our opinion the officers' actions in completing prompt initial enquiries at the man’s home address and in the surrounding area (with the assistance of a police dog unit), as well as at local pubs and the supermarket, were appropriate and proportionate.\\nEvidence showed that, when CCTV established that the man had not been to the supermarket, he was then reassessed as ‘high risk’, with no undue delay.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe completed our investigation in November 2018 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded, in autumn 2019, to publish its outcome.\\n\", 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Devon and Cornwall Constabulary']}\n",

Norfolk Constabulary was contacted, but they did not arrest him due to other operational priorities. \\xa0\\nOn 30 June an officer went to the man’s home but he wasn’t there, neither did he answer his phone.\\nAfter the man failed to answer bail on 10 July, an incident report was started with a vehicle check on the man. On 13 July the man was found dead.\\nOur investigators obtained and reviewed a number of records. We served one officer, who was the officer in charge of the criminal investigation, with a notice of investigation for potentially not fulfilling their duties and responsibilities. The officer responded to our questions and explained why they were not available to progress the investigation.\\nEvidence suggested that no specific concerns about the man were brought to the attention of the police that required a response in relation to his welfare. While there appeared to have been limited progress on the criminal investigation for which the man was arrested this seems to result from an initial lack of resources as well as the officer in charge’s shift pattern and other work priorities. There was no urgency to deal with the man as a priority offender. \\xa0\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe completed our investigation in November 2018 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded before publishing its outcomes.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Norfolk Constabulary']}\n",

It was agreed that the police would attend to assist, once the ambulance had been dispatched. NWAS had been called by one of the man’s parents and told that they should ask police to assist.\\nAfter several delays due to resourcing issues, and after receiving a further call from NWAS raising concerns about an outgoing disturbance, four GMP officers attended the address around 9.30pm. NWAS reported that the man had been on the phone to their control room and a woman could be heard screaming in the background. Two response officers arrived first and were talking to the man, his mother, and the man’s girlfriend at the door of the address when two more officers arrived. One of them joined the other two officers at the door speaking to the occupants, while the other waited further up the drive. During the conversation with the occupants, allegations of assault by the man against his father and his girlfriend were disclosed. Officers took the man’s girlfriend and his mother to the police van and the man’s girlfriend showed them a laptop, with a document listing various things the man had done to her, and documenting his behaviour over a period of time. BWV seems to show only one officer having read this document. The man’s girlfriend was taken to her mother’s home for her safety.\\nAround 10pm, one of the officers in attendance provided an update to the control room stating that the man was calm and there was no apparent role for the police. The two original officers re-attended the incident with the paramedics later that evening and did not disclose the document they had seen on the laptop. The man said he did not need any assistance, so the paramedics left, and the man remained at the address.\\nOn 28 November 2016, the man contacted GMP to report that his girlfriend had been stabbed. She subsequently died from her injuries. The man was later convicted of her manslaughter.\\nDuring the investigation, the Investigator served notices on the three officers who had been speaking with the man, his mother and his girlfriend at the front door to the address. The fourth officer was interviewed as a witness. We obtained other witness statements from one of the paramedics, the man’s mother and an inspector. We also reviewed BWV footage.\\nThe Investigator found an indication that one of the officers may have behaved in a way which would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings for failing to follow up the disclosures of potential crimes that were made to them while at the address, and failing to follow the force’s domestic abuse policy.\\nThe Investigator also found that the actions of another officer fell below the standard expected and recommended their performance issues be addressed. The Investigator did not find a case for the third officer.\\nAfter reviewing our report, GMP determined that there was insufficient evidence of misconduct for the first officer and considered that their performance had been unsatisfactory, and that there was insufficient evidence that the officer had deliberately neglected their duties or responsibilities. GMP proposed that the officer would receive further training on mental health and domestic abuse, with a monitored action plan.\\nThe force also determined that the performance of the second officer had not been unsatisfactory, but that they should receive feedback about the conclusion and learning from this incident.\\nAfter reviewing their rationale, we agreed that their proposals were appropriate.\\nWe completed our investigation in November 2017 but waited until the inquest into the death of the man’s girlfriend had taken place, in autumn 2019, before publishing our findings.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Greater Manchester Police']}\n",

The wanted man did not live at the house but was believed to be staying there with the person who owned it.\\nThe officers found the man hiding in the loft, detained him and escorted him to the living room of the house while they awaited a response unit to transport him to custody. The officers’ body-worn video footage shows that the man asked for a cigarette; while looking for tobacco, an officer found a small bag of a substance he believed to be cannabis. The man denied that the cannabis was his.\\nAfter another officer spoke to the homeowner on the phone, the officer who had found the cannabis informed the man that the homeowner had said the cannabis did not belong to them. The officer asked the man again if the cannabis was his, and the man shook his head.\\nAnother officer then asked the man to “cough the cannabis” so that the homeowner would not get into trouble, and the man nodded. The man asked what would happen if he admitted to possession of cannabis, and the officer replied, “f*** all”. The officers also told the man that that they would have to contact social services if the cannabis belonged to the homeowner, because children were living in the property.\\nThe man was later charged with possession of cannabis due to the admissions apparently made at the scene. During interview he denied the cannabis was his and said, “I was basically bullied into saying ‘yeah it’s mine’.”\\nThe interviewing officers raised this matter with their supervisor and the matter was referred to us in August 2018 as a mandatory conduct referral.\\nIn December 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charge of possession of cannabis against the man due to lack of evidence.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained body-worn video (BWV) footage from the officers who attended the incident. They also interviewed the officers. They obtained relevant policies and procedures, including on the use of BWV.\\nWe were of the view that, while the man claimed to have been bullied and pressurised by the officers, BWV appeared to show some brief interaction and attempted persuasion for him to accept responsibility for the cannabis, which did not support the officers’ actions as being threatening, persistent or bullying in tone. The evidence from all officers in attendance tended to support that there was a strong smell of cannabis on their arrival at the premises and that only the man was present inside.\\xa0\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that two officers, who tried to persuade the man to admit to possession of the cannabis, and did not challenge each other’s actions, had acted inappropriately. We were of the view that the third officer did not have a case to answer for misconduct.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Dorset Police advised that all three officers would receive management action regarding the use of BWV and the need to evidentially capture the full interaction or incident before BWV is turned off.\\nThe force agreed that the two officers had a case to answer for misconduct.

She had failed to return home after reportedly going to see a man. Friends were concerned that the woman had left her children alone, which was out of character. She had also failed to see friends or visit places where she was expected to, and wasn’t responding to messages.\\nThe MPS treated this as a ‘medium risk’ missing person’s enquiry. Officers began to make enquiries in order to locate her.\\nOn 24 September 2018, the woman was found dead in the back garden of a house where the man she was to meet with lived. The man has since been arrested and charged with the woman’s murder.\\nThe MPS referred this to us as a ‘death or serious injury’ matter and we began an independent investigation.\\nOur investigators reviewed the missing person’s report, local MPS policies and obtained accounts from the officers involved in the missing person’s enquiry. We served seven officers with notices that they were under investigation for a number of allegations, including that the medium-risk assessment for the missing person’s report may not have been appropriate, that officers had not undertaken appropriate lines of enquiry, that they may not have considered all available information when reviewing the missing person’s report, and that they may not have set meaningful lines of enquiry to progress the investigation. All seven officers provided us with an account.\\nEvidence suggested that missing person enquiries were conducted in line with the MPS Missing Person policy. The only possible further enquiry could have been an attempt to locate the man who the woman had met. However, with no surname, no address or other details such as date of birth, the evidence seems to show that there were no realistic enquiries that could have been made.\\nThe MPS missing person’s investigation protocol defines a ‘high-risk’ assessment as a risk which is immediate and where there are substantial reasons for believing that the subject is in danger through their own vulnerability, or may have been a victim of a serious crime. There was no evidence to suggest that the above criteria were met during the time officers were making enquiries to locate the woman. Evidence also indicated that the decision to keep the risk as medium when reviewing the missing person’s report was in line with missing person guidance, since there had been no change in circumstances.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed.\\nWe completed our investigation in July 2019 but waited until the criminal trial into the woman’s murder had concluded before publishing its outcomes.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

He said he could hear whispering and was worried someone was going to kill him. The call handler recorded that the man was suffering with paranoia and advised him to call the Ambulance Service. The call handler discontinued the call after five minutes; he started to create a log of the call and recorded that police would not be attending.\\nAt 1.57pm, the man called ‘999’ again and spoke with a second call handler. He stated he was unsure if it was paranoia, but he believed someone was breaking into his home. The call handler discontinued the call after nine minutes. This call handler updated the log and requested that a supervisor assess the call, for police attendance to be considered.\\nAt 2.07pm, the man called ‘999’ and spoke with a third call handler. During this call, he became agitated. Crashing and banging could be heard in the background and the call handler believed he was breaking things in his room. The man said that he had not taken medication for his paranoid schizophrenia. He also said he had taken cocaine and was feeling unwell. The call handler remained on the phone with the man for 49 minutes and upgraded the call to ‘prompt’, which required police attendance within 60 minutes.\\nAt 2.22pm, Devon and Cornwall Police called the Ambulance Service and asked them to go to the man’s home, as they suspected he was experiencing a mental health crisis. The Ambulance Service advised that the man was third in the queue for ambulance attendance. At 4.40pm, the police called the Ambulance Service again.\\nThe information recorded on the police log indicating that the man had not taken his medication, had taken cocaine, and was feeling unwell was not passed to the Ambulance Service. By this time, the man was 20th in the queue for ambulance to attend.\\nAt 6.18pm, the Ambulance Service informed the police that, after gaining access to the man’s home, he had been found dead.\\nThe post-mortem indicated that the man had died from toxic levels of cocaine. It was not possible to determine whether earlier medical intervention could have led to a different outcome.\\nDuring our investigation, our investigators obtained call logs of the calls made by the man to the police, and by the police to the Ambulance Service.\\nWe interviewed and obtained statements from officers and staff within the force contact centre. We reviewed prioritisation of calls within the relevant policing area on the day. During our investigation we found indications that one call handler, three radio dispatch officers (RDOs) and a police sergeant may have behaved in a manner which would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings.\\nBased on the evidence available, as the end of the investigation, we were of the opinion that one call handler had a case to answer for misconduct for not taking appropriate action to safeguard the man, despite identifying him as vulnerable, and for being abrupt and dismissive with the man during the call. We were also of the view that one RDO had a case to answer for misconduct for not taking action to deploy police officers to the man’s address despite being required to do so by Devon and Cornwall Police policy, and for not taking appropriate action to safeguard the man despite identifying him as vulnerable.\\nWe found there was no case to answer for the other two RDOs or the police sergeant.\\nAfter reviewing our report and decision document, Devon and Cornwall Police agreed that the call handler had a case to answer for misconduct. As the call handler had left the force, no further action was taken. The force also agreed that the RDO had a case to answer for misconduct and proposed to deal with this by management action to ensure the RDO reflects, learns and is given the skills and training to perform their role, especially in relation to management of safeguarding risks.\\nOur investigation highlighted a need for Devon and Cornwall Police to achieve greater clarity in their approach to concern for welfare cases. The force agreed that our investigation had revealed some wider issues and departmental failings.

As the officer had already been dismissed from the force for another, unrelated case, no further action was taken. The officer was placed on the barred list of former officers who cannot work for the police service in the future.\\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) determined there was insufficient evidence to charge the officer for misconduct in public office and improper use of police powers and privileges. The complainant exercised their right to a review of the CPS decision, however, this did not result in the CPS changing their decision.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Corruption and abuse of power', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Sussex Police']}\n",

He did not return home that night. The following day, at around 9am, his mother telephoned Humberside Police and reported him as missing.\\nA call handler graded the call as a ‘concern for safety’, requiring a prompt response, meaning officers should attend within two hours. The supervising inspector continued to treat the log as a ‘concern for safety’ until the end of his shift at 5pm. The next supervising inspector on duty began to treat the log as a high-risk missing person.\\nOn 16 December Humberside Police received a call about a possible sighting of the man taking a taxi to a location in Lincolnshire at around 11.40pm the previous evening. The force contacted Lincolnshire Police shortly before 3pm. A Lincolnshire Police officer conducted a general search in his vehicle around the area where the man was reported to have been taken to by the taxi, but could not locate anyone fitting his description.\\nThe man’s family conducted their own enquiries and found him dead around 11.55pm on 16 December. He was found close to the location where the taxi had dropped him off, in the Lincolnshire Police force area.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed the officers and dispatchers involved in the incident, reviewed the incident logs, and phone calls made to the police. They also obtained statements from several witnesses, including police staff and the family and friends of the man.\\nEvidence indicated that, although the log was not officially graded as ‘high risk’ until shortly before the man was found dead, both forces carried out a number of actions in line with national policy for a high-risk missing person investigation.\\nWe found that, even though the Humberside Police call handler had graded the call as ‘concern for safety’, they had told the man’s mother that they would treat him as a missing person, which was not in line with local or national policy. We were of the opinion that this could best be handled with learning, so the call handler was aware of national policies and definitions, and of the force’s expectations in relation to duties and responsibilities of call handlers and missing persons reports.\\nWe were also of the view that the actions of one inspector, who did not record the man as missing from the outset, fell below the standard expected by the national and local policies, and that this should be handled by learning via management action. As the inspector had since retired, no further action was taken.\\nWe were of the opinion that a third inspector, who did not re-grade the log as a ‘missing person’ – but took actions appropriate to a high-risk missing person investigation – would benefit from learning.\\nWe were also of the view that a number of officers and staff from both forces would benefit from learning debriefs, to ensure the learning from this investigation is shared.\\nWe highlighted an area of improvement for Humberside Police, regarding ensuring that Authorised Professional Practice (APP) relating to the definition of a missing person is applied, and that all staff are aware of the definition.\\nWe recommended that Lincolnshire Police review its local missing person policy and bring it in line with definitions set out in APP guidance.\\nWe also recommended that Humberside Police and Lincolnshire Police work together and with any other cross-border policing areas to ensure their local policies include: agreed methods of contact and transferring information in relation to missing persons; transference of management and supervision of missing person reports; and an agreed escalation process, if any force is concerned about inaction/risk level from a partner force and that these are shared throughout the forces.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Lincolnshire Police advised that they had already revised their missing person policy in line with APP, which now includes cross-border co-operation for missing persons investigations.\\nHumberside Police also agreed with our proposals.\\nBoth forces have now reviewed and shared their working practices and policies.\\nWe completed our investigation in March 2019 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded, in autumn 2019, before publishing its outcome.

During this investigation, it was established the target of these statements was actually a relative.\\nDuring the investigation, the man was located and interviewed and the case against him was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). However, no further action was taken due to lack of evidence. There is no indication the man’s relative was spoken to as part of this investigation.\\nSome years later, the man kidnapped two women, including his relative; he sexually assaulted both, seriously injured his relative and killed the other woman. During his criminal trial, his relative also stated he had sexually abused her in the past. Following the trial, the judge for the case wrote a letter to the commissioner of the MPS, questioning whether enough had been done during the investigation in 2013/14.\\nIn addition, the man’s relative made a complaint to us on 5 April 2018, stating MPS officers failed to conduct effective investigations into the man’s crimes.\\nDuring our investigation, we attempted to gather information in relation to the MPS investigations in 2013 and 2014. However, much of this information did not appear to be located where it should have been on MPS systems, this included interview tapes and the physical case file.\\nWe made attempts to gather the relevant information from other agencies, such as the CPS, magistrate’s courts and safeguarding services. We took statements from police officers who had taken part in the search for relevant documents. Our investigators attended a number of MPS storage units to carry out physical searches. However, some of the documents remain unfound.\\nDuring our investigation there was an indication two former police officers – who had since retired from the MPS – may have behaved in a manner which would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings. Both provided a written response to a number of allegations put to them. These included:\\nFailure to carry out a search – We were of the opinion the decision not to execute the search warrant was an error. When officers arrived at the property, which was linked to the IP address used to post threatening messages online, the man’s former partner said he no longer lived there. In our opinion, a search of the address should have been performed in order to establish this fact.\\nFailure to arrest the man – As three months had passed between the officers going to the man’s last known address and locating him, in our opinion there would have been little to be gained as it is likely he would have been made aware of the officers visiting his home address and destroyed any evidence. Therefore, in our opinion, the voluntary interview that the suspect had attended was sufficient.\\nFailure to follow lines of enquiry – During his interview, the man told the officer that it was not him who had made the statement online, but another man, who had admitted this to him. He also told the officers he had sold his computer, and so they were unable to check this. There was no evidence that the officer followed any lines of enquiry to check the man’s account was correct.\\nFailure to maintain satisfactory record keeping for the investigation – The documents relating to the 2013/14 investigation that were recovered had very little in the way of rationale for decisions made by the officer throughout the investigation. As the case file was not been located it was not possible to comment on whether the rationales made by the officer were satisfactory or not.\\nFailure to safeguard the complainant during or following the investigation – The man’s relative was not spoken to at the time. No paperwork was located in regard to a threat to life notice being issued or considered and no referral was made to other agencies to ensure her safeguarding. In our opinion, the complainant was not given the opportunity to have facts about the potential threat posed to her.\\nFailure to supervise the investigation – The officer’s supervisor did not challenge the decision not to perform the search, did not ensure lines of enquiry were followed and did not safeguard the complainant.\\nThe officer and their supervisor were no longer serving officers with the MPS when our investigation began. However, we were of the view that, had the officer and their supervisor still been serving, we would have regarded their overall performance as unsatisfactory and asked the MPS to consider a performance plan for both of them.\\nBased on the difficulties experienced in locating the case file and interview tapes from the 2013/14 investigation, we recommended that the MPS may wish to review their audit process for the movement and storage of exhibits and case files along with any other stored material.\\nWe upheld the man’s relative’s complaint that officers had failed to conduct effective investigations into his crimes, those who were co-accused and associates. In our opinion the evidence suggests the performance of the officers involved in the overt investigation was unsatisfactory.\\nWe did not consider that officers had been negligent in their duties, but that it was a matter of poor performance, and therefore did not uphold that complaint.\\nWe did not uphold the complaint that officers were guilty of misfeasance in a public office. In our opinion, there was no evidence to suggest any officer committed a criminal offence.\\nWe completed our investigation in July 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed with our findings.\\nRegarding the learning highlighted by our investigation, the MPS responded that the processes for recording and retaining material relating to criminal investigations are clearly defined, but agreed that these had not been followed correctly in relation to this particular case. The force advised that, although some of the issues had now been overcome through improved technology, the department should be reminded of their obligations and the processes to follow.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Metropolitan Police']}\n",

The member of the public initially handed the papers over to an online news reporter, who subsequently returned it to Cleveland Police. The force identified the work book as belonging to one of their officers, who had stored it at their home. Cleveland Police recovered the rest of the sensitive material from the officer’s home and returned it to police premises.\\nCleveland Police referred this to us as a conduct matter. The force also contacted all the people named in the work book to inform them of the release of their information to the public. Seven of them made complaints about the breach of their personal data, and the impact on them personally. We also investigated some of their complaints.\\nThe evidence obtained during our investigation indicated that a Cleveland Police officer removed two bags containing some sensitive work-related material from police premises to their home. Our investigation found evidence that this material had been stored at the officer’s home for approximately four weeks before some of it was found by a member of the public.\\nOur investigators interviewed the officer and obtained statements from other relevant officers and several witnesses. We also reviewed relevant policies, guidance and legislation.\\nThe evidence confirmed that the officer did remove the bags containing sensitive material from police premises and took them home, knowing some of the material was sensitive. While the officer explained why they stored the bags in their study, which the officer considered to be secure, the officer did not appear to have properly considered the risk to the data within their home, nor made attempts to secure or remove the sensitive material from their study to police premises at any time during the following 27 days.\\nThe officer provided an explanation for how the material ended up outside of their house, which eventually led to a member of the public subsequently finding one of the work books in the road and contacting a national newspaper reporter. In our opinion, that served to undermine the officer’s stated view that they believed the material was safe in their study.\\nPolice officers have a responsibility for the information they handle and process. Although officers can take sensitive material away from the police station when required to do so for a legitimate policing purpose, the increased risks to the security of this material should be considered. We saw little evidence that the officer had due appreciation of these risks, and there was no legitimate policing purpose in the officer removing this material from the police station and retaining it at their home for such a period.\\nWe found no evidence that the officer deliberately disposed of the sensitive material by placing it outside their house. However, taking such material home and leaving it unsecure within their properly would amount to a very serious error on the officer’s part, if proven.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that a reasonable panel, properly directed, could find a case to answer for gross misconduct for the officer.\\nOur investigation also identified that another officer appeared to have failed to ensure the sensitive material that was contained in the bags was stored, processed or protected in a manner compliant with the Data Protection Act or Cleveland Police force policies. We were of the view that this officer may benefit from receiving management action.\\nWe also suggested that the force may consider reviewing their Data Protection policy.\\nWe completed our investigation in August 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report and provisional opinions, Cleveland Police initially determined that the officer had a case to answer for misconduct only. We did not accept that determination. After further exchanges of views, the force agreed that the officer should attend a gross misconduct hearing. Cleveland Police also advised they would review their Data Protection policy to ensure it is adequate.\\nThe officer attended a gross misconduct hearing in autumn 2019 where gross misconduct was proven. The officer was given a final written warning.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Cleveland Police']}\n",

When they arrived, both officers switched on their body worn video (BWV) cameras to record the incident. The woman appeared to be behaving aggressively towards a member of the public, and one of the officers tried to divert her attention.

As the police car overtook vehicles, the driver failed to respond in sufficient time as a black car started to turn right in front of it. The two vehicles collided. The police car veered off to the right, mounted the pavement and struck a pedestrian, who sustained serious injuries.\\nOur investigators obtained statements from the passenger in the police car and the driver of the black car. They also reviewed the footage from the police in-car video system and interviewed the driver of the police car.\\nThroughout the investigation the investigator considered that there was an indication that the police driver may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings or committed a criminal offence.\\nThe available evidence indicated that the police driver could have avoided the collision.\\nBased on the evidence available, in our opinion, the police driver drove in a manner and at a speed that were neither justified nor proportionate in the circumstances. We were also of the view that, as a trained advanced driver, the police driver should have displayed a markedly higher level of hazard perception than an untrained driver, particularly while engaged in a response drive, and that they had not extended their driving skills beyond that of a careful and competent driver.\\nGiven the evidence obtained by the investigation and the seriousness of these identified potential breaches of the Standards of Professional Behaviour, in our opinion there was sufficient evidence that a reasonable panel, properly directed, could find that the police driver had a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nWe completed our investigation in April 2019.\\nWe also submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in April 2019 to consider whether the police driver may have committed a criminal offence.\\nAfter reviewing our report, West Yorkshire Police agreed that the police driver had breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour.

The victim of one of these offences was the partner of a serving West Mercia Police officer. The man appealed the convictions and sentence in respect of the offences.\\nFollowing a report by the officer’s partner that there was graffiti by their house, which they believed the man had been responsible for, in July 2018, a police officer went to their home to obtain a statement from the officer’s partner. While there, he observed the file of papers relating to the man in the officer’s possession and raised this as an issue with one of the inspectors. The matter was passed to a chief inspector, who conducted an interview with the officer in which the officer gave their reasons for retaining the file. It became apparent that the officer had assumed an officer in case (OIC) role for the ongoing appeal matter. The officer said they had not conducted any systems checks on any of the parties involved.\\nThe matter was referred to Professional Standards Department. An audit of systems access was carried out, which showed that the officer had conducted checks on the man, on their partner and themselves on police systems, which did not appear to have a legitimate policing purpose.\\nWest Mercia Police referred this to us as a conduct matter in July 2018.\\nWe reviewed relevant force policies and obtained statements from a number of police witnesses. We also interviewed the officer under caution.\\nThere was no obvious explanation for why the officer made searches relating to themselves and their partner. No reason appears to have been documented at the time to explain this and the officer gave no reason during their interview. The officer carried out other searches that appeared to have a legitimate purpose and be commensurate with their role of OIC. However, we were of the opinion that the officer should not have been OIC. The officer should have flagged searches they were carrying out in relation to the ongoing case in respect of the man, in line with the force policy. This in turn would have alerted the supervisor to the potential conflict in their continuing as OIC. The officer accepted this was an error in judgement. We noted that the officer had done nothing that could be considered to have enhanced the evidence available or in any way made the case stronger than it initially was.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the officer may have a case to answer for misconduct.

He was searched, then his vehicle was searched, and he was arrested for possession of class A drugs with the intent to supply. The man was taken to Grays custody suite and placed in a holding cell. A short time later the man became unwell. The custody sergeant called for a medical professional to see him. The medical professional and the officers carried out first aid, and an ambulance was called. The man was taken to hospital, where he later died. A post-mortem concluded the man had died from cocaine toxicity.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators collected CCTV, witness statements, and policies. Forensic analysis on some evidence was also conducted. There was no CCTV footage or body-worn video footage of the search.\\nDuring the investigation, conduct was identified for two of the officers involved relating to the search of the man and risk assessment, and the handling of evidence. We interviewed both under misconduct caution.\\nEvidence indicated that drugs were recovered from the man’s car. A tin containing drugs was later found in the man’s holding cell. Following the man’s death a ripped plastic bag was found in his jacket pocket that contained traces of drugs, and what appears to be the other half of the plastic bag was found in the rear of the police car that the man had been transported in.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find, on the balance of probabilities, that one officer’s search of the man had not been thorough; that the officer’s risk assessment may have been flawed, as the man appeared to have ingested cocaine during his search and arrest; and that the officer may have failed to provide adequate care and attention to the man by leaving him unattended.

The officers explained that they would search her under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The woman put her hand in her pocket and did not follow instructions to remove her hand. One of the officers took hold of her hand and a struggle began between the officers and the woman. The two officers called for assistance and two more officers arrived within a minute. Shortly after the arrival of the other officers, the woman was taken to the ground. She sustained an injury to her right arm, suspected to be a broken arm. She was taken to hospital but discharged herself before treatment could be completed.\\nThe woman was subject to a missing person’s enquiries but, to date, has not been located.

The matter was resolved by way of no further action.\\nThe woman was subsequently released from custody and the investigating officer, who had finished his shift, took her home in his personal car.

It was alleged that during this time, the investigating officer drank wine and had sexual intercourse with the woman.\\nOn 19 July 2018 the woman’s ex-partner complained to us that the investigating officer’s conduct with her was an abuse of his position and suggested the officer had improperly influenced the outcome of the domestic assault investigation.\\nWe interviewed the investigating officer under gross misconduct caution.

The intelligence was that five people had recently moved into the man’s property and it was believed that they were growing cannabis there. As a result, an incident log was created and graded as level 2. This requires a response within an hour. Initial checks were completed and the names of two men were included on the incident log. One of these men was the occupant at the address. It is not clear who the second man was, but it is thought he was a previous occupant at the same address.\\nAt 12.13pm on 24 June 2018 an officer went to the man’s home and received no response. The officer recorded on the incident log that the level of concern was relatively low but it may be beneficial to attend during the hours of darkness to see whether any lights were on at the property. There was no evidence that an officer revisited the address that evening.\\nAt 10.26am on 25 June 2018, a police sergeant reviewed the incident and asked that enquiries were made with the housing provider to establish who the occupant was.\\nAt 4.04pm on 25 June 2018 and at 8.42am on 26 June 2018, a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) went to the man’s home and reported there had been no answer and they would try again. The PCSO went back to the man’s home that afternoon, but did not inform the force control room that he had completed this visit. The PCSO knew the man, but did not pass on this information.\\nAt 8.38pm on 27 June 2018, GMP received a report of concern for the welfare of a man. An officer attended the man’s house at 11.01pm and received no response. The officer completed other enquiries into the occupant, but believed they were looking for the other man mentioned on the incident log (believed to be the previous occupant), and so enquiries completed related to him. The officer requested that someone attend during the day and for checks to be made with the housing provider.\\nAt 9.15am on 28 June 2018 after several unsuccessful attempts to speak to the man and after it was identified his mobile phone was in the property (prior to this, there was evidence from neighbours that he may be visiting family) the decision was made to force entry into the man’s home. At 9.52am he was found dead in his home.\\nOur investigators took statements from the PCSO and the officer who attended following the second concern for welfare report. We reviewed audits conducted by the force to see who accessed information in relation to the address, and the two men on the incident log.\\nWe considered the actions of the officers involved in the response to the calls about the man before he was found dead. The PCSO appeared to have been in possession of information which they did not share with the control room, namely, the man’s identity and the fact they made a third visit on 26 June 2018. This information may have factored into the risk assessments, but there was no evidence to indicate it could have prevented the man’s death.

Police signalled for the vehicle to stop by activating their blue lights. The vehicle made off at speed. Police pursued the vehicle through residential and commercial areas and along the A34. The vehicle exited the A34 and crashed into a roundabout. Both the driver and passenger of the vehicle sustained broken backs in the collision.\\nThames Valley Police referred this incident to us on 31 December 2018. On 9 January 2019, the driver of the speeding vehicle made a complaint about his treatment by police following the collision. The driver alleged that, immediately after the collision, officers used excessive force on him during his arrest, that an officer who arrived at the scene a short time after was rude to him, and that he was treated harshly and incorrectly by officers and was kept in the cold while waiting for an ambulance.\\nIn the course of investigating the circumstances of the accident and the driver’s complaint, we received and analysed CCTV footage from the pursuit car, the incident report and the incident data record for the police vehicle, as well as witness statements and ambulance records.\\xa0\\nEvidence indicated that the pursuit was proportionate and necessary to stop the driver from driving erratically and at speed, and that the police vehicle was marked and fitted with suitable audio and visual equipment, as required by the guidelines. The police driver had the necessary training and qualifications to engage in the pursuit.\\nBecause the police car’s dashcam was switched off before the ambulance arrived at the scene, there was a period of time that was not recorded. Therefore, during this time, there was no objective evidence that either supported or refuted the man’s claim that police used excessive force, were rude to him or kept him in the cold. The only available evidence was derived from accounts of the man, the passenger and the two police officers. Neither officer reported using the level of force described by the man. The passenger’s account did not support the man’s claim either.\\nOne of the officers stated that the man was given a first-aid ‘space’ blanket. Officers did not provide the man with warm clothing, or moved him to a vehicle to stay warm before then.\\nBased on the evidence available, we did not uphold the man’s complaints that officers used excessive force on him, or that an officer had been rude to him.\\nHowever, we upheld the man’s complaint that he had been treated harshly and incorrectly by officers and kept in the cold.\\nAlthough we did not identify any particular guideline which says that arresting officers must ensure that detainees are kept warm or comfortable, we were of the view that both officers would benefit from being reminded of their responsibility to look after the health and welfare of their detainees.

He said he wanted to hand himself in to police and asked if officers were on their way. The call handler told him they did not know, but had forwarded the call to despatch operators, advising the man wanted to hand himself him.\\nThe record of the call was later updated with a note that the man could hand himself in at a local police station and any threats to him were already being managed by the police. The call was closed.\\nApproximately four hours later, the man was stabbed multiple times by individuals who had forced their way into the property where he was at the time. He received serious injuries during the assault and went to hospital for treatment.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained and reviewed information held on the MPS computer systems. This included the call handling record, the voice recording of the call, information relating to the threats as well as relevant policies, guidance and training documents. We also reviewed relevant national guidance.\\nThe first thing the man told the call handler was that he was not reporting an emergency. He said he was ‘at large,’ meaning he was wanted by police. The man did not focus on the threats to life he had received during the call, but mentioned them as the reason why he had removed his tag, which was the purpose of his call to the police. Throughout the call the man’s voice was even and calm, and he gave no indication that he was scared or concerned. We were of the view that resolution without deployment of officers was an appropriate response to the man’s call.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence. However, we recommended that the control room supervisor should be reminded of the importance of keeping callers updated with the outcome of their enquiries/contact with police – the supervisor had closed the call without informing that man that no officers would be attending and that he should hand himself into a police station.\\nWe completed our investigation in August 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report the MPS agreed and advised they would address this with the member of staff concerned.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

The officers were responding to an emergency incident. In order to make progress around queuing traffic, the driver of the police vehicle positioned the vehicle into the oncoming traffic lane, which was clear.\\nWhile in the lane for oncoming traffic, the driver of the police vehicle went through a red light on a pedestrian crossing, striking a member of the public using the crossing. The injured person was treated at the scene and taken to hospital by ambulance, however, there was no indication the person had suffered serious injury.\\nWhile at hospital, further tests confirmed the pedestrian’s injuries were more serious than initially believed. The pedestrian suffered three broken ribs as a result of the collision.\\nSussex Police Roads Policing Unit began an investigation and obtained a statement from the injured pedestrian before the incident was referred to us.\\nWe interviewed the driver of the police vehicle twice on suspicion of dangerous driving. The passenger in the police vehicle was interviewed as a significant witness. The police vehicle was not equipped with video recording equipment or other equipment which would enable analysis of the speed of the vehicle or manner of driving.\\nWe obtained witness statements from members of the public who saw the collision, however, the collision was not captured by any local CCTV cameras.\\nWe obtained radio transmissions, 999 calls and police incident logs, in addition to a report from a collision investigator and technical information about the pedestrian crossing.\\nWe also obtained and reviewed relevant law, policy, training and guidance.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were satisfied that at the time of this incident the police driver was responding to an emergency incident and was therefore authorised to use their exemptions, allowing them to break traffic law, as long as their actions could be justified and did not cause danger to other road users.\\nEvidence indicated that the police driver was approaching a pedestrian crossing which was green to pedestrians from the wrong direction. We were of the view that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find that the fact that the police driver did not see the pedestrian crossing before they made the decision to ‘offside’ indicated they failed to assess all the potential hazards of ‘offsiding’ and therefore failed to follow policy and training. It could also find the decision to drive on the wrong side of the road was inappropriate in the circumstances.\\nThe police driver failed to give an indication of their actual speed at the time and stated they were driving at a speed appropriate to the circumstances. We were of the view that it should fall to a tribunal to decide whether the police driver’s speed was appropriate in the circumstance.\\nWe completed our investigation in March 2018 and submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider a charge of dangerous driving. We also sent our investigation report to Sussex Police, to consider a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nIn May 2018 the CPS authorised a charge of dangerous driving.\\nIn January 2019, the first day of the trial, the police driver offered to plead guilty to an alternative charge of careless driving, which was accepted by the court. The officer was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge.\\nThe officer resigned from the police force in March 2019.\\nSussex Police agreed the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct in April 2018. Following the officer’s conviction for careless driving, a gross misconduct hearing commenced on 1 July 2019. The hearing was adjourned after the panel chair expressed his view that the matter before him did not amount to gross misconduct and suggested Sussex Police review the seriousness of the alleged conduct.\\nSussex Police reviewed the evidence and decided to re-determine the seriousness of the conduct. The force notified us that they now considered this was an issue of misconduct only. We accepted the re-determination and, as the officer had already resigned, no further action was taken.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Road traffic incidents', 'Sussex Police']}\n",

The car failed to stop but was not pursued by police. At around 4am, a separate police unit spotted the black Hyundai and started to pursue it. During the pursuit, the suspect vehicle struck a pedestrian using a crossing, knocking him to the ground and causing serious injuries. At this time the suspect car was out of sight and the police did not witness the accident. A few moments later, the pursuing police car passed by the injured pedestrian, but did not stop. The suspect car was then discovered abandoned, with the driver’s whereabouts unknown.\\nOur investigators attended the scene and the post-incident procedure in order to independently assess the collection of evidence and obtain accounts from officers involved. We obtained the police airwave recordings related to the pursuit, and additional accounts from the officers involved, in order to further clarify their actions. We took witness statements from the injured party, his friends and family present, and other witnesses to the collision. We also accessed police logs of the incident and were able to see the information recorded by control room staff.\\nWe assessed the above evidence to ensure it was in line with national and local policy and legislation.\\nThe download of the in-car data did not show that the police car was involved in a collision, this is corroborated by photographic evidence of the police car involved.

The evidence further showed that both officers acted in line with their training and followed force guidelines and procedures in their pursuit of the stolen car.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.

The care worker alleged that, in the process of using excessive force on the young woman, the officer also caused her injuries, which included a bruise to her forearm and marks to her wrist.\\nDuring the course of the investigation, investigators interviewed the arresting officer and their colleague, obtained a number of statements from independent witnesses, and reviewed the officers’ body-worn video footage as well as CCTV from the venue of the incident.\\nWe served the officer with a notice of investigation stating that, based on the evidence, there was an indication that they may have used force which may not have been necessary, proportionate or reasonable, and that they may have acted without self-control, tolerance, respect and courtesy.\\nThe evidence suggested that the officer has been informed that the young woman may have been in possession of weapons such as glass shards and razor blades. The officer approached her with the intention to restrain her for her own good. It appears that the officer was then immediately assaulted and in great pain. We were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could conclude that the officer’s actions were appropriate at that moment in time. The officer then took the young woman to the ground using an approved technique and in line with legislation. We therefore considered that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for use of force.\\nThe evidence also appeared to show that the officer used language that could be perceived as inappropriate when dealing with a vulnerable young woman. Taking into account the circumstances, and the acknowledgement of their behaviour, we were of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for the lack of courtesy shown, but recommended that the officer’s conduct should be addressed by management action.

At the time the allegations were raised, the officer (officer A) was an acting Detective Sergeant (A/DS), line managing a number of police constables (PCs). These PCs approached a senior officer and reported a number of instances when Officer A’s behaviour had caused them concern. Many of the allegations dated from when Officer A was acting as a Detective Sergeant.\\nThe allegations included Officer A having possession of offensive weapons, using racist and derogatory language, having obtained and shared a photograph of a personal nature from a colleague’s phone without her consent, behaving in a bullying manner towards subordinates, and moving a key piece of evidence in an attempt to strengthen a case against a suspect in a burglary investigation.\\nThese allegations came to our attention on 22 January 2016 as a conduct referral.\\nOfficer A was suspended from duty in June 2016 following further allegations that arose during the course of our investigation.\\nIn the course of our investigation we obtained over 100 statements from police officers and members of the public, and examined over 350 documents and 100 exhibits. We also examined a number of national and local policies.\\nAll of the officers who reported concerns provided us with detailed witness accounts. We also obtained additional statements from other MPS officers, police staff and members of the public.\\nWe interviewed Officer A under criminal caution three times regarding the allegations.\\nWhen interviewed regarding the allegation that they had provided factually inaccurate information in a statement as to where a key piece of evidence was found, Officer A declined to answer any questions in interview, choosing instead to provide two written responses, denying the allegation.\\nWe also investigated concerns raised by a number of the officers whom Officer A worked with that Officer A had used racially offensive and discriminatory language in person, in emails and via WhatsApp messenger in regards to the ethnicity, sexuality and perceived disability of members of the public and colleagues. Evidence indicated that Officer A appeared to use words, phrases and epithets that may be perceived as offensive on a regular basis. Officer A’s use of words that were racist or misogynistic or otherwise offensive appeared contrary to the Code of Ethics.\\nEvidence suggested that Officer A possessed offensive weapons and had on occasion carried a knuckleduster while on duty. Other evidence indicated that the officer had interviewed a man who was on bail without authority, and had obtained and shared a personal photograph of a colleague without her authorisation.\\nOn the basis of the evidence available we were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find that Officer A had a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nWe completed our investigation in November 2017. We sent our report to the MPS who determined that the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct.\\nOfficer A attended a gross misconduct hearing in autumn 2019. The independent panel considered the following allegations:\\nAllegation 1: the independent panel noted that Officer A completed a statement saying they had found a stolen battery in a suspect’s bag during a police search. Other evidence contradicted their evidence. The panel found that Officer A had made an untruthful statement and that the allegation was proven and amounted to gross misconduct\\n.Allegation 2: at the hearing, Officer A admitted to using some offensive and/or discriminatory language between 11 April 2014 and 14 January 2016. Officer A denied using other language of a racist nature, as heard by other officers. The Panel accepted the officers’ account and concluded that Officer A had used the racist language, and that the allegation was proven.\\nAllegation 3: a colleague of Officer A alleged viewing a photo of a colleague of a personal nature on Officer A’s mobile phone. Although the Panel did not see the photograph, the Panel noted that a degree of trust and evidence existed between Officer A and the colleague who made the allegations, and rejected Officer A’s account that their colleague had made it up. The allegation was found proven at the level of gross misconduct.\\nAllegation 4: a knuckleduster was allegedly seen in Officer A’s bag, and Officer A also admitted being in a possession of a police-issued lock knife they should have returned when leaving the specialist police unit that had issued it. The allegation was found proven at the level of misconduct.\\nAllegation 5: Officer A was alleged to have attended the home address of a suspect on bail without authorisation. The panel found the allegation proven at the level of misconduct.\\nThe panel considered a further allegation, but found this to be unproven.\\nOfficer A was dismissed without notice.

While at the address, it was alleged, a police officer inappropriately disclosed sensitive and personal information to a third party.\\nOfficers at the scene removed a number of items from the premises to a nearby police station. These items were exhibited and placed in a police property store. One of the items seized was the man’s wallet, containing £65.\\nAn officer then arranged with the man’s partner to return the wallet by posting it through the letterbox of the property in which she was staying. The wallet, however, was mistakenly posted through the wrong letterbox. This became apparent the following day, whereupon the wallet was recovered and taken to the correct address. The £65 from wallet was not returned at this stage.\\nOn 7 June 2015, the man’s partner registered a complaint regarding the disclosure of sensitive personal information to a third party, the return of the wallet to the wrong address and failure to return the £65. All of these allegations related to one officer.\\nOn 16 July 2015, the officer received notification of the complaint. The £65 was subsequently located in the area where the registration and bagging of the items took place.\\nHumberside Police Professional Standards Department began an investigation and discovered that, just after being notified of the complaint, the officer left the police station and withdrew £50 cash from his bank account. Shortly after this withdrawal, the £65 was found. The investigation was then referred to us in July 2016 as it reached the mandatory referral criteria of corruption and potential criminal offences.\\nOur investigators re-interviewed the officers involved in the incident, from attending the scene of the man’s death to the eventual serving of the regulation notice. We also contacted members of the public relevant to the enquiry as witnesses. The officer’s pocket notebook and the exhibit bags were subject of forensic analysis. We interviewed the officer who was the subject of our investigation under criminal caution.\\nUpon conclusion of the investigation, the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could conclude the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct in relation to three allegations: inappropriate disclosure of sensitive and confidential information, mishandling of property, and the dishonest retention of £65 from the man’s wallet. We concluded our investigation in September 2017.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Humberside Police determined in September 2017 that the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct and that the officer should attend a gross misconduct hearing.\\nIn September 2017 we also submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) so they could consider whether the officer had committed theft and had also perverted the course of justice.\\nIn August 2018 the CPS made a decision to charge the officer for both offences.\\nIn June 2019 the officer appeared at court and pleaded guilty to the offence of perverting the course of justice, and in doing so accepted committing the theft. The officer was convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison. The same day the officer resigned from Humberside Police, however, a special case hearing heard the allegations relating to the theft and dismissed him, ensuring he was placed on the College of Policing barred list.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Humberside Police']}\n",

The driver of the motorcycle was not wearing any protective equipment. The motorcycle continued to be monitored and various tactical options were considered to stop it. At approximately 2.18am an MPS police car made physical contact with the motorcycle. The driver lost control of the motorcycle, fell onto the road and was detained. The driver, a seventeen-year-old, was then transferred to hospital. He sustained fractures to his skull, foot and eye socket.\\nThe police officer who was driving the police vehicle that made contact with the motorcycle had carried out a manoeuvre known as ‘tactical contact’. He was made a subject of the investigation for allegations of excessive use of force.\\nDuring the investigation, we reviewed footage from the police vehicles involved and from a helicopter that was assisting. We analysed data from the police vehicles on-board computer, which showed that the likely speed of the police vehicle at the time of the impact was 42mph.\\nOur investigators interviewed the officer and obtained statements from several witnesses. We examined the evidence in the context of the information available regarding this specific incident, policy and legislation and the national use of tactics to prevent and deal with motorcycle crime. We also gave consideration to the rise of motorcycle-enabled crime in the MPS and to public confidence in policing.\\nBased on the evidence available, and after consideration of additional information received from the MPS, we were of the opinion that the force used by the officer when using tactical contact on the moped driver was disproportionate and unreasonable. Although this was a deliberate application of force, there was no evidence of malice to aggravate the potential breach of the standard.\\nOur view was that there was sufficient evidence that the officer had breached the Use of Force standard of professional behaviour, and should attend a misconduct meeting. We completed our investigation in January 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed to hold a misconduct meeting for the officer.\\nAt the meeting, held in Autumn 2019, the panel did not find misconduct proven in relation to the use of tactical contact, but determined that the officer should receive formal management action around how his justification for using it had been presented.\\nOur investigation highlighted a need for clear national policy and guidance to be developed on the use of tactical contact in relation to two-wheeled vehicles and similarly vulnerable road users (see learning recommendation below).\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': \"The IOPC recommends the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) ensures that clear national policy and guidance is developed on the use of tactical contact (use of force involving police vehicles) in relation to two-wheeled vehicles and similarly vulnerable road users.

The guidance should help Tactical Pursuit and Containment (TPAC) trained and authorised drivers assess the most appropriate tactic to resolve a pursuit situation of a two-wheeled vehicle with the least risk of harm, and set out the range of tactics available to them.

He was taken to Kings Lynn Police Investigation Centre, where he was detained overnight. Before being released from custody, the man was seen by a liaison and diversion practitioner, where he disclosed that he had epilepsy and hadn’t had access to medication. (The ‘liaison and diversion’ service works with people involved in the criminal justice service who have an identified vulnerability; practitioners do not provide treatment.) This information was passed on to the custody officer, who released the man at 11.20am on 23 July 2018. The man was due to get a bus home.\\nThe next day, the man was found dead in a water-filled ditch near the bus stop close to the Police Investigation Centre.

We served a custody sergeant with a notice that their conduct was under investigation, and interviewed them under misconduct caution.\\nEvidence indicated that the custody sergeant did not appear to have acted on any of the ‘red flags’ relating to the man’s epilepsy and on his Police National Computer and custody records. There appears to have been a breach of policy in not seeking a healthcare practitioner’s (HCP) view regarding the man’s epilepsy and need for medication. We were of the view that the custody sergeant could have taken a few relatively simple steps: calling for a HCP, asking the man a few extra questions, asking him to wait inside until the bus was nearer, or arranging police transport for him.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for the custody sergeant, and that their acts and/or omissions should be considered at a misconduct meeting.

A call taker took some details from the caller to establish the man’s whereabouts and a description, and created a ‘call’ that they graded as ‘immediate’. No officer was available at the time to deploy.\\nAt 1.49am a control room supervisor changed the call grading to ‘telephone resolution’. This grading does not require a police attendance.\\nAt 1.50am TVP received another call concerning the same man, and further calls were received after that. The incident grading was changed back to ‘immediate’.\\nAt 2.06am a police unit was dispatched to deal with the incident and arrived at the scene at 2.09am. At 2.19am, officers reported that they had found a body in the central reservation. The man was pronounced dead at 2.20am.\\nOur investigators reviewed the 999 calls made to Thames Valley Police as well as the command logs generated around this incident. A review of the initial call gave rise to concerns that the call taker may not have recorded concerns expressed by the caller as to the safety of the individual. There were also concerns that the call taker may not have asked questions to allow for a better assessment of the risk to the man.\\nWe served two members of TVP staff with notices alleging breaches of the Standards of Professional Behaviour. Our investigators were only able to interview the call taker. The other member of staff, the control room supervisor, retired shortly after the incident and did not engage with the investigation, nor provide an account.\\nThe call taker admitted that they did not ask additional questions to better understand the incident or record all the information provided by the caller. They explained that they assumed that other people would understand the dangerousness of the situation and, with hindsight, understood they were wrong to make this assumption.\\nThe call taker agreed that being new to the role was a factor in their not asking additional questions. At the time we interviewed them, the call taker had been in post for an additional six months and was therefore more experienced and had gained learning from that.\\nWe were of the view that the call taker had a case to answer for misconduct and that this would best be addressed by management action. This would ensure their manager had an understanding of the issues involved and the learning which had come out of it, which would allow for the call taker to receive appropriate support.\\nWe were also of the view that the control room supervisor appeared to have inappropriately regraded the incident as not requiring police attendance. As they did not engage in our investigations, we were unable to ask them questions regarding their rationale. We were of the opinion their decision appeared to have been wrong and that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could have found they had a case to answer for misconduct, had they still been serving. As the control room supervisor had retired, no further action was taken.\\nWe completed our investigation in July 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, TVP agreed.

Shortly afterwards Sussex Police closed the call.\\nOn 6 July the woman’s body was found on train tracks nearby.\\nOur investigators obtained witness statements from all officers and police staff who had a role in handling the matter, as well as from the community psychiatric nurse who made the initial call and the member of staff at the hostel.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the performance of one police officer may be considered to be unsatisfactory, in that they failed to identify that the woman was a missing person or that she had warning markers for violence and suicide and was wanted for bail offences; they also closed the call after an officer went to the woman’s hostel, without further investigation as to her location or welfare. We were also of the opinion that the performance of a member of police staff, who had not recorded the woman as a missing person, but marked the call as a ‘concern for welfare’ has also been unsatisfactory.\\nOur investigation highlighted some learning for the force around reminding all force staff of the definition of a missing person as per the Authorised Professional Practice.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Sussex Police agreed, and both the officer and member of staff received management action to address performance issues. The force also confirmed that it had addressed the area of learning highlighted by our investigation with two force briefings: a 60-second briefing to all staff, as well as the circulation of a “public protection learning briefing”.\\nWe completed our investigation in December 2018 but waited until the inquest into the woman’s death had concluded, in summer 2019, to publish its outcomes. The inquest recorded a verdict of suicide.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Sussex Police']}\n",

He continued to be verbally and physically resisting.\\nAs the man was being taken through the custody area, an officer approached him and addressed the man using language that may be considered insulting. The officer then pulled the man forward at speed with his hands around and beneath the man’s neck, forcing the man’s head downwards as he moved backwards at speed.\\nThe officer continued to move backwards with the man in a backwards headlock and entered the cell. The officer then pulled both of the man’s arms, which were handcuffed to the rear, up 90 degrees and, holding the cuffs with one hand and the man’s jogging bottoms with the other, lifted the man in the air, bent at the waist with his head down.\\nThe officer then adopted a ground pin technique where he again lifted the arms up to and beyond a 90-degree angle with their left knee placed in the rear of the man’s neck, giving leverage and downward pressure from the knee to the neck.\\nThe incident was brought to the attention of Northamptonshire Police Professional Standards Department. The force then referred this matter to us in November 2017.\\nOur investigation centred around the alleged use of force by the officer. We served six officers with notices that they were under investigation. We interviewed all of them under caution.\\nOur investigators obtained and reviewed footage obtained from the officers’ body-worn video cameras. As the incident had taken place over 30 days before, CCTV footage from the custody suite was no longer available.

Our investigators also sought advice from a Lead Officer Safety Trainer regarding the restraint techniques used by the officer, including holding the man by his neck.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable misconduct hearing could find that the officer had breached the standards of professional behaviour and had a case to answer for gross misconduct for their use of force, and for using insulting and abusive language when dealing with the man.\\nWe were also of the view that four officers would benefit from management action for not challenging the officer’s behaviour.\\nWe completed our investigation in October 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Northamptonshire Police agreed that the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct and should attend a gross misconduct hearing. Regarding the other four officers, they agreed that the performance of three of them had been unsatisfactory, and that they would receive management action. They proposed that the fourth one, who had raised concerns with another officer, would be given management advice from a senior officer.

The staff members gave chase and, assisted by members of the public, restrained him until the police arrived.\\nAn officer from Suffolk Constabulary initially attended and took over the restraint of the man while waiting for colleagues to arrive. The officer saw what appeared to be a plastic bag sticking out of the man’s trouser pocket, which he believed could be drugs, but took no action at this stage. Upon the arrival of additional officers, the man was allowed to sit up, was handcuffed, and was then allowed to stand up. As he was walked towards a waiting police vehicle, the man began to struggle and was taken to the floor, where he was restrained. Once compliant, he was again stood up and walked towards a waiting police vehicle. A subsequent search of the man and the scene failed to locate the plastic bag.\\nOn the journey to the custody suite, one of the officers became concerned that the man may have something in his mouth and that he was making regurgitating noises. When challenged, the man denied this and showed the officer that his mouth was empty.

After he was arrested and transported to custody at Tonbridge Police Station, the man collapsed while he was having his fingerprints taken, and died shortly after.\\nDuring the post-mortem examination, a plastic bag was found in the man’s stomach. Further tests revealed he had high levels of cocaine in his system.\\nOur investigators attended the scene on the day of the incident and conducted house-to-house and CCTV enquiries. We obtained a number of statements from officers and members of the public, as well as relevant policies and procedures.\\nEvidence indicated that officers had attended the man’s home on 13 October to arrest him following a domestic violence incident reported on 1 October. After seeing evidence that the house was occupied, officers decided to force the door, after shouting several warnings through the letter box, due to concerns for the safety of the man’s partner. We were of the opinion no reasonable tribunal could find the officers’ beliefs in this regard were irrational or contrary to the evidence as it presented to them.\\nOfficers forced entry to the property, and accounts indicated that they saw the man place two fingers in his mouth. They asked him and his partner whether he had swallowed something, which was denied, and officers were told the man had been ill. Officers saw no evidence of drug paraphernalia in the home or on the man, and there were no medical signs that the man had anything in his airways. CCTV evidence in custody shows the man talking to officers in a normal manner, and denying having taken any drugs. Officers therefore formed the opinion that the man had not swallowed anything.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe were of the opinion that the performance of all three officers could be considered unsatisfactory for some of their risk assessment and decisions before forcing entry into the man’s home, including their understanding of their powers of entry.\\nWe were also of the opinion one of the officers should be reminded of the importance of promptly providing the custody sergeant with all information which may be of relevance, given the custody sergeant was not advised of the gagging incident. We also suggested that two officers, who did not turn on their body-worn videos (BWV) when arriving at the address, should be reminded of the force policy that there is a “strong presumption” they will turn their BWV on, particularly when using police powers and attending domestic incidents.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Kent Police advised that all three officers would receive management action.\\nWe completed our investigation in August 2018, but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had taken place, in summer 2019, to publish our findings.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Death and serious injury', 'Kent Police']}\n",

This prompted officers to follow the vehicle into a residential estate, where they activated the blue flashing lights and sirens of the police vehicle to signal to the van driver to stop. Following this, as the van exited the residential estate, the driver suddenly accelerated and made off. The police vehicle followed in a pursuit of the van, which lasted approximately 31 seconds.\\nThe pursuit came to an end when the van drove onto the wrong side of the road and collided head-on with another vehicle. The two occupants of the other vehicle died at the scene of the collision.\\nThe driver of the van was later sentenced to nine years in prison after pleading guilty to causing their deaths by dangerous driving.\\nOur investigators attended the scene and post-incident procedure. During the investigation, we obtained written accounts from the officers involved in the pursuit and members of the public who witnessed the aftermath of the collision. We also gathered expert reports. We reviewed information held on the MPS computer systems, body-worn camera and dash-camera footage, in addition to relevant policies, procedures and legislation.\\nEvidence indicated the collision occurred in the initial stages of the pursuit, which was very short in duration. During the pursuit, the police vehicle was never in close proximity to the van. We were satisfied the pursuit was justified, necessary and proportionate in the circumstances and carried out in line with relevant national and local policies and procedures.\\nEvidence also showed that one of the officers made every effort to access the vehicle the van had collided with after realising that the driver and occupant were inside. Officers requested an ambulance as soon as they were aware of the injuries of all involved. In our opinion, the officers acted professionally and did all they could in difficult and tragic circumstances following the collision.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.

We were of the view this was an omission and not a deliberate act and, that it did not amount to misconduct. We were of the opinion that Officer A should be reminded of the importance of clearly communicating the reasons for an arrest to avoid confusion, and hopefully reduce the chances of similar situations occurring.\\nEvidence showed that Officer A did not provide the man with aftercare after using the incapacitant spray, which is against policy.

The officers decided to conduct a routine stop on the Golf and made efforts to catch up with it. On regaining sight of the Golf, officers turned on the police car’s blue lights, but the Golf failed to stop and the police vehicle entered into a pursuit with it.\\nAt around 11.25pm, the Golf crashed into fencing bordering a rural road in Hereford. The Golf then turned on its roof and landed back on the road, where it collided head on with the pursuing police vehicle.\\nThe Golf’s passenger was provided with medical care but, shortly after midnight on 18 December 2016, he was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the Golf was later found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained expert advice from a collision investigator and a police driver trainer. We also obtained data recorded relating to the police vehicle’s speed, distance, acceleration and direction travelled and asked an expert to analyse and interpret the data.\\nInvestigators interviewed the driver and passenger of the police vehicle under misconduct and criminal caution. It was alleged that, before the crash, the police driver was travelling at an unsafe speed, bearing in mind the road conditions and visibility, and had also appeared to fail to inform the control room that the pursuit was taking place and to seek authorisation to continue the pursuit.

The officer handcuffed her before transporting her to a custody suite. During her transportation, the officer saw the woman apparently trying to reach into her clothing. When she arrived at the custody suite, the custody officer authorised a strip search. During the booking-in procedure, the woman asked to use the toilet. While using the toilet, the woman produced a quantity of drugs within a plastic capsule that she apparently had concealed on her person. The woman became violent and, while in the process of being restrained, she assaulted two police officers. A number of officers were required to physically restrain her and apply handcuffs and limb restraints. While officers kept her under constant observation, the woman apparently suffered a period of unconsciousness and she was taken to hospital for medical treatment.\\nApproximately four hours later she returned to custody, where she remained until she was released the following day. Although the custody officer recorded the woman’s period of unconsciousness on her custody record, he did not mention it in an adverse incident form. As a result, Durham Constabulary Professional Standards Department was unaware of the incident and did not refer it to us until February 2019, following an internal review of ‘death or serious injury’ (DSI) incidents.\\nDurham Constabulary charged the woman for possession of controlled drugs and assaulting of two police officers. The officers involved compiled statements on the day of the incident in April 2018, which our investigators examined as part of our investigation. We obtained additional accounts from a number of officers and also examined documentation, including the woman’s custody record and risk assessment forms. All officers and staff co-operated with our investigation.\\nOur investigation established that the woman may have become unconscious as a result of her taking drugs and alcohol before her arrest. Our investigation found no evidence to suggest that Durham Constabulary either caused or contributed to her becoming unconscious.\\nDuring the investigation there was no indication that any police officer or member of police staff may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings or committed a criminal offence. We completed our investigation in July 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Durham Constabulary agreed with our findings and undertook to reinforce identified learning regarding ensuring that their custody staff understand the definition of a DSI incident and the importance of accurate and up-to-date record keeping.\\xa0\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Durham Constabulary']}\n",

The police vehicle followed and a pursuit was authorised.\\nOfficers in the police vehicle lost sight of the car they were pursuing. However, the National Police Air Service (NPAS) helicopter was nearby and assisted by following the route of the suspect car, providing commentary over the police radio.\\nNumerous police vehicles made their way to the location of the suspect car, following the commentary of NPAS. At various points throughout the pursuit, police saw the suspect car and twice came close to it, but pursuit tactics such as stinger or containment were not employed, as police were unable to get into the correct position to carry them out due to way the suspect car was being driven.\\nApproximately 11 minutes after the pursuit began, the decision was made by police to terminate and withdraw.

Essex Police investigated the circumstances of the man’s death. In the course of its investigation, Essex Police noted that a number of police vehicles had passed the site of the initial collision – en route to an unrelated incident – on the M25 without stopping.

They also analysed policies and procedures to determine the correct course of action officers potentially could have taken on the night in question.\\nForce policy dictates that both officers (in separate cars) should have contacted the control room and sought advice from a road’s policing sergeant about approaching and managing the scene.

The caller also explained the man had made previous attempts to take his own life. However, they also stated the man had failed to return previously and noted he had left the hospital calm and pleasant.\\nThe initial contact handler at Sussex Police logged and reviewed the incident and graded the call as high risk, requiring police response within a maximum of 15 minutes. Subsequently, others reviewed the log and various conflicting decisions were made in respect of the most appropriate police response. The call was downgraded, closed, re-opened and then held until the morning for the next shift of officers to action.\\nAt approximately 8.30am, an officer was tasked with making enquiries to locate the man. However, the man was found dead by a member of the public less than two hours afterwards. The post-mortem report stated the man had died of heroin toxicity.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators obtained a written account from a supervisor in the force communications department regarding allegations that their decision to close the call without any further police action was inappropriate in the circumstances.\\nThey also spoke to witnesses, reviewed information held on Sussex Police computer systems, CCTV, airwave recordings and relevant policies, procedures and legislation.\\nEvidence indicated that the supervisor had considered the man to be absent without leave (AWOL), rather than missing, and asked the hospital to make further checks. The force’s AWOL policy notes other factors needed to be present for a person to be considered as ‘missing’ in the first instance. We did not consider that there was sufficient evidence of risk to suggest that the supervisor’s decision to treat the man as AWOL was inappropriate in the circumstances. However, it appeared that no review period was agreed with the hospital to reassess the man’s status. We were of the opinion that it was inappropriate to close the call without setting this.

This was based on the information received that the man may be aggressive towards officers and in possession of a sword. He was arrested for assault and affray.\\nThe man complained to TVP that he had been Tasered while he was standing still and compliant. Unhappy about the outcome of this complaint, the man made a complaint to us. Following the man’s appeal over TVP’s decision to dismiss his complaint, we opened an independent investigation in February 2017.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators collected statements from the officers and the man, and examined CCTV footage and other related documents.\\nBased on the evidence presented, we were of the view that the deployment of Taser-trained officers was appropriate in the circumstances based on the information available at the time that the man was in possession of a sword and would be aggressive to the officers.\\nCCTV footage showed that the man was standing still and was compliant with one of the officers’ command to stand still, and he was not in possession of a sword. In conjunction with the man’s statement, CCTV footage showed that he did not move towards the officers, which could negate the need for a pre-emptive strike.\\nThe Investigator formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for the officer who discharged the Taser, for not using reasonable force.\\nThe Investigator was also of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for both officers for providing inaccurate information regarding the incident in their initial and further statements.\\nWe completed our investigation in December 2017.\\nAfter reviewing our report TVP disagreed with these opinions. Their view was that the officer who discharged the Taser had an honestly held belief that they were faced with a threat that justified use of force, and that both officers perceived the man to be non-compliant and moving towards them.\\xa0 TVP also disagreed that the officers may be considered to be dishonest because their accounts appeared inaccurate in comparison to the CCTV. In summary, the force disagreed that the officers may be considered to have a case for misconduct.\\nAfter a lengthy exchange of views with TVP, we directed them in August 2018 to hold a misconduct meeting for the officer who discharged the Taser.\\nAt the misconduct meeting, which took place in December 2018, an independent panel found misconduct not proven for the officer who discharged the Taser for their use of force. The panel found the officer’s use of force was in line with Common Law provision in defence of themselves and others, and that the discrepancy in the way the officer described the man moving towards them compared to CCTV was due to the officer being in a stressful situation and perceptual distortion.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Use of force and armed policing', 'Thames Valley Police']}\n",

The man resisted arrest and officers used force to restrain him. Officers placed him in the back of a police van and took him to a police station.\\nEn route to the station, the man became unresponsive. The officers pulled over, took the man out of the van, called an ambulance and began first aid. The ambulance arrived and took the man to hospital, where he subsequently died.\\nOur investigators attended post-incident procedures and seized or secured evidence from the officers involved in the incident.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the officers involved in the search, arrest, restraint, transport and first aid given to the man. They obtained and analysed various evidence, including video footage, witness statements, medical records, radio transmissions, expert reports and relevant policies/legislation.\\nInvestigators found indications that five officers might have behaved in a manner which could have breached the police Standards of Professional Behaviour and may have a case to answer for misconduct. Four were interviewed regarding the allegation that they may have failed in their duty to safeguard the man’s welfare. A fifth officer provided a written response to the allegation that they failed to be diligent in their duty to appropriately supervise the officers concerned and protect the integrity of the evidence-gathering processes after the incident.\\nEvidence indicated that two of the officers suspected that the man may have put something in his mouth and asked him whether that was the case, and to open his mouth. We were of the opinion that, at that point, the officers should have either conducted a search of the man’s mouth or, if he was unco-operative/resistant to that, then conveyed him to hospital as soon as possible – rather than take him to a police station in a police van.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that both officers may have a case to answer for misconduct. We recommended that one of them receive management action and that the other one, who had assumed a ‘lead role’ during the incident, should attend a misconduct meeting.\\nWe were also of the opinion that the fifth officer’s decisions to allow the officers to travel together, without explicitly explaining the non -conferring rules, and to allow one of the officers to switch off their body-worn video before the post-incident procedure were inappropriate and did not follow guidance.

The man was later found guilty of the woman’s murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.\\nOur investigation found that the woman had reported to Sussex Police that the man was stalking her in February 2016. The man was given words of advice over his behaviour. In March 2016 Sussex Police received a report that the man had allegedly assaulted the woman. When it was revealed that the woman had been in a relationship with the man after initially denying it, an officer warned her about wasting police time. Over the following months, she reported further incidents regarding the man, included him stealing her house key and entering her bedroom. Sussex Police never arrested the man on suspicion of stalking.\\nDuring the investigation, we found indications of possible misconduct or gross misconduct for 14 police staff and officers, who all provided evidence. Our investigators also interviewed multiple witnesses, some from within Sussex Police, and others who were personally known to the woman. They carefully analysed the response of Sussex Police to the man and the woman, against local policies, College of Policing guidance, and legislation.\\nOur investigation showed that police officers and staff reported feeling ill prepared to deal with allegations of stalking, and that training was not provided by Sussex Police to deal specifically with this issue. We made a number of learning recommendations to the force, as well as two national recommendations (see below).\\nBased on the evidence available, and after discussion with Sussex Police, three officers attended disciplinary proceedings.\\nOne officer was found to have a case to answer for misconduct for not giving the woman an opportunity to respond to allegations made by the man and giving her ‘words of advice’ about wasting police time, and for failing to consider force policies on domestic abuse. As the officer was no longer serving, no further action was taken.\\nAnother officer was found to have a case to answer for gross misconduct for not complying with force policy regarding protection from harassment and domestic abuse, failing to adequately address prevalent issues while dealing with the woman, and for failing to respond to a report made by the woman. The officer would have been dismissed had they still been a member of a police force. Their name was placed on the police barred list.\\nA third officer was given a written warning at a misconduct meeting after being found to have committed misconduct for not taking past incidents, or the domestic context of the woman’s allegations, into consideration when deciding on police course of action.\\nThree more officers received management action.\\nWe completed our investigation in June 2018 but waited until all disciplinary proceedings had completed, in summer 2019, before publishing its outcomes.\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'Recommendation to Sussex PoliceWhen officers or staff move to a different role they should be given training and support to carry out the new role.

He was subsequently acquitted of this offence on appeal.\\nDuring the arrest, officers took the man to the ground on two occasions and also deployed incapacitant spray against him twice.\\n\\xa0At the time of the arrest, police officers in the area had been authorised to use their legal powers to disperse individuals from Castle Park for up to 48 hours. These powers apply where officers have reasonable grounds to suspect that the behaviour of an individual has contributed, or is likely to contribute, to members of the public feeling harassed, alarmed or distressed, or to the occurrence of crime or disorder. A police inspector authorised the use of the powers following a report of affray the previous day, which involved individuals who were of Somali ethnicity.\\nThe man complained to Avon and Somerset Constabulary that only people of Somali ethnicity had been dispersed in this manner, that he had been unlawfully arrested and that officers had used excessive force against him due to his ethnicity. The force referred this matter to us in August 2018.\\nOur investigators issued an appeal for witnesses (which received no response) and reviewed CCTV, police body-worn camera and mobile phone footage of the incident. They obtained accounts from the man and from all police officers visible in the video footage of the arrest, and interviewed the officers who used force against the man under criminal caution. Investigators also obtained expert opinion on the use of force.\\nEvidence indicated that the decision to authorise the use of dispersal powers was reasonable and not based on ethnicity. The evidence did not indicate that officers discriminated against the man who was arrested, or anyone else in Castle Park, due to their ethnicity.\\nAlthough the magistrates’ court subsequently found that the arrest of the man was unlawful as the officer did not give the grounds for arrest as soon as reasonably practicable, the officers believed at the point of arrest that the arrest was lawful, and acted in line with their common-law right to self-defence.\\nRegarding the use of force, the investigation found that the use of handcuffs, the initial decision to take the man to the floor and the first use of incapacitant spray were reasonable and proportionate. It was not possible to tell whether the man was resisting against officers before being taken to the ground for the second time. Evidence showed that the officer who discharged incapacitant spray on the second occasion did so at less than the minimum recommended distance of one metre from the man – national guidance indicates this can be justified in some circumstances. Evidence also showed that the man did not receive appropriate aftercare in the initial period after being subject to the use of incapacitant spray; he was given only cursory verbal reassurance and was shut inside the police vehicle for a short period before being exposed to fresh air. He suffered no lasting effects as a result.\\nThe investigation also found that, when the man was detained in the police vehicle, the officer who used the incapacitant spray on the second occasion, and who alleged that the man had assaulted\\xa0 him in the initial moments after the arrest, made comments to the man that were inappropriate and unnecessary in the circumstances.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nHowever, we suggested to the force that the arresting officer should receive a debrief regarding the danger of applying pressure to the back of a subject in the prone position, and that the officer who discharged incapacitant spray on the second occasion should be debriefed regarding doing so at less than the minimum recommended distance, and regarding their use of language. We also suggested that both of the officers who discharged the spray should be debriefed regarding the provision of aftercare after using it.\\nWe completed our investigation in March 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report Avon and Somerset Constabulary agreed to implement the suggested actions.

She subsequently died in hospital.\\nWe investigated the contact the woman had had with GMP prior to her death.\\nWe initially recovered a large amount of material from GMP relating to their contact with the woman, from May 2016 through to the date of her death.\\nWe obtained statements from members of police staff, police officers and support workers who had involvement with the woman during the final weeks of her life. We also examined and considered material relating to police contact.\\nEvidence showed that the woman had considerable police contact during the timespan of the investigation into the allegations she made about her alleged abuser. Evidence from her support worker suggests that the woman was positive about the ongoing police investigation and had not raised any issues with them regarding its progress or the police officers involved in it. There was no evidence to suggest that the police may have caused or contributed to the woman’s death.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe concluded our investigation in March 2019, but waited until the inquest into the woman’s death had concluded in summer 2019 before publishing its outcome. The inquest jury’s conclusion was that the woman had died from traumatic injuries following a fall from a height.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Greater Manchester Police']}\n",

This was the first domestic abuse incident between the couple to be reported to Dorset Police.\\nDorset Police subsequently placed a ‘Domestic Abuse – standard’ warning flag on the woman’s record.\\xa0\\nA few weeks later, Dorset Police received a referral after the woman had been to hospital and disclosed that the injuries she had sustained had been caused by her partner, and that he had assaulted her five or six times before that.\\nFollowing this, a Dorset Police Domestic Abuse Advisor (DAA) made several attempts to contact the woman by telephone over several weeks, but the woman did not answer. No answerphone message was left, as it may not have been safe to do so.\\nThe woman was also discussed at a Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC), and a ‘Domestic abuse – MARAC’ warning flag was placed on her record.\\nThe woman did come into contact with Dorset Police on two separate occasions during the time that the DAA was trying to make contact with her.

The force recorded the incident as a missing person and conducted enquiries to locate the woman. Officers established a possible location for the missing person, based in Essex.\\nSuffolk Constabulary officers then sent an email to Essex Police requesting officers attend the property. Officers went to the property in the early hours of 4 December 2018 and discovered the woman unresponsive.

In addition, the woman’s partner raised complaints with our investigators regarding officers’ response to the incident and subsequent actions.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained and reviewed airwave recordings, documentary evidence and body-worn video footage.

The man and the woman were spoken to over the phone by the same Cleveland Police officer. An appointment was made for the woman to be seen by a Cleveland Police officer and, as the man lived in the Cheshire force area, he was asked to go to his local police station to make a statement.\\nAt 12.44am on 29 March 2018, Cleveland Police emailed Cheshire Constabulary Control Room stating that the woman had reported a crime of domestic-related harassment and that the suspect was her ex-partner. The woman had reported that her relationship with the man ended in January 2018 and that he started sending her abusive and threatening messages. In an email to Cheshire Constabulary, Cleveland Police outlined that the messages from the man included him threatening to kill himself, and made reference to his being depressed and suicidal.\\nCleveland Police stated that the man was likely to be sending the messages from his home address and therefore the crime was committed in Cheshire. Cleveland Police requested that Cheshire Constabulary record the crime and stated that the woman wanted the man to be spoken to regarding his course of conduct and warned about his behaviour.\\nAt 1.48am Cheshire Constabulary replied to Cleveland Police via email stating that the crime needed to be recorded by Cleveland Police as, although the man lived in Cheshire, there was no evidence that the messages were sent from his home address. Cleveland Police responded, asking that a Cheshire Constabulary officer visit the man to deliver words of advice. This email was not opened until 9.57pm that same day.

He left the flat to go to a place of safety and waited there for police officers to come and talk to him. WYP graded the incident as an emergency and tasked officers to visit the flat. The man’s partner refused to co-operate with the police and there was insufficient evidence to suggest a crime had been committed, so the officers left.\\nShortly afterwards the same officers were tasked to meet with the man. When they arrived, they witnessed what appeared to be the man attacking his partner with a weapon while she was on the ground. One of the police officers tackled the man and took him to the ground. As a result of this tackle the man sustained seven broken ribs and a punctured lung. The man subsequently made a complaint to WYP that the officers had assaulted him.\\nDuring the investigation our investigators studied CCTV footage from a nearby retail establishment and obtained witness statements from the officers involved and the injured complainant. All WYP officers and staff co-operated with this investigation. Investigators also examined relevant documentation related to the incident and considered the officers’ actions against local and national policy and legislation.\\nThe officer’s stated belief was that he honestly believed the man was assaulting a person on the ground with a metal bar and, as a result, took decisive action to protect both that person and the officers themselves from harm, by tackling the man to the ground. The CCTV footage, the second officer’s account and the man’s own account support the officers’ interpretation of the incident they were faced with as soon as they arrived at the scene.\\nWhile the available evidence indicates that the man’s injuries were caused by his interaction with WYP officers, it does not support his complaint that he was assaulted by a WYP officer and therefore that the use of force was unreasonable and/or excessive.\\xa0\\nBased on the evidence available we were of the opinion that the officers had justified their use of force, and considered their actions to have been reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances. We were also satisfied that the officer’s use of force was not excessive and was necessary, and that the man’s injuries were an unintended consequence.\\nOn the basis of the evidence collated during the investigation, there was insufficient evidence to support the man’s allegations, and so we did not uphold the man’s complaint.

The call operator noted on the system that the woman reported someone banging on her door and buzzing her buzzer. The woman informed the call operator that she believed the person may have been her ex-husband. The call was graded as ‘significant’ by the call operator, for which the MPS target response time is 60 minutes.\\nPolice officers were initially allocated to attend the woman’s home, but were then diverted to attend an ‘immediate’ graded call, and did not go to the woman’s home.\\nOn 1 June 2018 at 2.30am, the woman made a 999 call to the MPS from hospital. She informed the call operator that, at around midnight earlier that evening, her ex-husband had kicked open her door, entered her home and assaulted her. The woman’s ex-husband was convicted of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\\nThe woman later said that she passed the telephone to someone else to speak to the call operator, and that the call operator had put the phone down after telling that person that they would need to speak directly to the woman reporting the assault.\\nWe investigated the MPS’s response to the woman’s requests for police assistance and her complaints regarding police response to her calls.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the staff in the Force Control Room who dealt with the calls made by the woman and the two police officers who were allocated to attend the woman’s first call to the police for assistance.\\nOur investigators also reviewed the police incident reports and listened to the calls made by the woman to the police. They examined MPS policies regarding call handling and special schemes that alert police staff to risk connected with an individual to see whether they were properly followed.\\nEvidence showed that, when the woman called on 31 May 2018, she said she didn’t know who was banging on her door, but she believed it could be her ex-husband. Due to the uncertainty, the call handler therefore did not treat this as a domestic incident. The woman was under the impression that her phone number was flagged to result in a high-priority response from the police if she called them. The investigation identified that this was not the case and the marker had been removed from her property in January 2018. Our investigation did not identify any deviation from MPS guidance in relation to the removal of the marker from the woman’s home.\\nEvidence also indicated that Force Control Room staff were unaware that officers had diverted to another incident, which meant that no new unit was reallocated to deal with the woman’s call for assistance. Evidence suggested that there had been a breakdown in communications when officers were diverted to another, higher-priority, incident, and that systems and policies were not resilient enough to manage that particular situation. \\xa0\\nThe evidence also showed that, when the woman called from the hospital, the call handler said they would pass on the details to the officers dealing with her previous call, and that officers did attend the hospital to speak to her.\\nWe identified some learning for the force in a number of areas and made three recommendations to the MPS (see below).\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence. We did not uphold the woman’s complaints. We completed our investigation in June 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed.

She was subsequently de-arrested and transferred to hospital as she felt unwell. The woman was arrested the following day following her discharge from hospital and her detention was authorised.\\nThe custody sergeant placed the woman on Level 1 general observation with 30-minute welfare checks. She was assessed by a healthcare practitioner (HCP) to assess her fitness for detention and interview. It was noted in the custody record that the woman had been given diazepam for alcohol withdrawal when she was in hospital. It was also noted she had declared herself to be alcohol dependent and that three additional diazepam tablets provided by the hospital had been placed in her property. The HCP recommended Level 1 general observation with hourly welfare checks, but the custody sergeant kept the woman on 30-minute welfare checks. During her detention, the woman was seen by the HCP, who noted she was showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, but did not give her any diazepam.\\nWhile in consultation with her solicitor, the woman had a seizure. She received medical attention and was transferred to hospital by ambulance.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed custody staff, examined CCTV footage, obtained medical documentation, and reviewed local and national policies, procedures and legislation.\\nEvidence showed that officers completed risk assessments during the woman’s detention and that she was assessed by a HCP to determine her fitness to be detained and interviewed. These actions were in line with policy. The woman was placed on Level 1 general observation with 30-minute welfare visits throughout her detention, regardless of the HCP recommending hourly visits. The custody record indicated that the woman was subject to regular monitoring. No emerging issues were identified during the welfare visits recorded, and there is no indication from CCTV evidence that she suffered any seizures before the one she had when with her solicitor.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence. We completed our investigation in May 2018.\\nWe made a referral to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) regarding the HCP so they could determine whether the HCP provided appropriate medical treatment. The NMC advised in December 2018 that, after reviewing all the information, the Case examiner had determined that the HCP had no case to answer and that no further action was required.\\nOur investigation highlighted some areas for improvement for Dyfed-Powys Police around reminding custody staff that welfare visits using the cell spyhole, viewing screens or CCTV are not sufficient, and reviewing its custody policy so that it reflects the College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice in relation to cell checks.

The car came to a stop a couple of minutes later. The driver of the car stood in the sunroof of the car and threatened to throw a house brick at the police officers in the pursuing vehicle. He then exited the car and ran in the opposite direction. The driver in the police vehicle drove behind the man, and as the man turned behind a stationary bus, the police vehicle collided with him. The man was arrested for dangerous driving. He suffered from a broken knee cap, a twisted ankle and cuts and bruises\\nOur investigators were provided with CCTV footage showing the collision between the police vehicle and the man. We obtained witness statements, as well as a report from a police collision investigator.\\nDuring the investigation, there was an indication that the driver of the police vehicle had behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings and may have committed a criminal offence. We interviewed the driver under misconduct and criminal caution.\\nAt the end of the investigation, based on the evidence available, the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct in respect of PC the police driver for being engaged in a pursuit without obtaining the necessary authorisation from the control room at the earliest opportunity.\\nHowever, the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct in respect of the police driver for continuing the pursuit in the police vehicle after the man had left his vehicle on foot; for driving a police vehicle directly towards the man, resulting in the vehicle running over him; and for removing the man from underneath the police vehicle with no regard to the injuries he could have sustained.We concluded our investigation in October 2017.\\nWe submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for consideration of criminal offences. After reviewing the file, the CPS decided in February 2018 that the police driver should be charged with dangerous driving.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Nottinghamshire Police did not agree that the police driver had a case to answer for gross misconduct for the three allegations. Their view was that the driver had not deliberately run the man down, and that neither the collision report nor the CCTV evidence support findings of that nature. The force proposed to deal with the police driver’s performance under the Unsatisfactory Performance Procedure, stage 3.\\nWe reviewed the force’s rationale, and did not agree that this matter should be dealt with as a performance matter. We recommended that disciplinary proceedings in the form of a misconduct hearing should be brought against the police driver, which the force accepted. Disciplinary proceedings were suspended until the trial had taken place.In early 2019, the matter went to court, and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. It was settled at court that the police driver’s decision to pursue the man in the car in an attempt to cut off his escape by blocking him was legitimate.\\nNottinghamshire Police reviewed their determinations in spring 2019 in the light of the judgement, and considered that the police driver’s manoeuvre had not fallen below professional standards to the extent it would be considered as amounting to misconduct or gross misconduct, and that it was a performance issue. They proposed to deal with the matter by way of management action, in the form of a reflective discussion between the officer and chief constable.\\nAfter reviewing their revised determinations, we agreed that their proposal was appropriate.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Use of force and armed policing', 'Nottinghamshire Police']}\n",

Their accounts corroborate that they discussed a relevant ongoing neighbourhood land dispute at length, however, there is controversy over what was discussed in regard to the report of racial abuse and what actions the officers agreed to take going forward.\\nFollowing the home visit, the computer record for the incident was updated with a note saying that this was not a racial crime but an ongoing civil dispute over land. One of the officers reported that they tried knocking at the door of the person suspected of racial abuse (it later transpired that the person whose door they knocked on was not the person suspected of racial abuse).\\nApproximately five weeks later, the member of the public phoned the Safer Neighbourhood Team to ask for an update and was told that nothing had been recorded. She subsequently made a formal complaint about how her report of racial abuse had not been recorded as requested, and made comments regarding the timeliness of the officers’ attendance and considerations for the welfare of her children and herself.\\nEvidence suggests that, once they became aware of the complaint against them, the two officers communicated via text and in person, which could have potentially amounted to collusion.\\nThis matter came to our attention in May 2017 as a complaint referral.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the complainant, served notices on and interviewed the officers, identified various police witnesses and obtained statements from them, and attempted to contact the racial abuse suspect.\\nInvestigators analysed the complainant’s initial report and subsequent statements, the information available to the officers before, during and after the home visit, and analysed various records, emails and texts sent after the home visit.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that one officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct for not recording accurate information following the home visit, and for attempting to collude with another officer following receipt of the complaint.

Officers reported that the man kicked the side of the van during the journey.\\nThe man was placed before the custody sergeant, where it was reported that he refused to engage. He was taken straight to a cell by the arresting officers so he could be searched, still handcuffed. Officers proceeded to search the man and remove his shoes. The arresting officer reported that he then asked to the man to get to his knees so that his handcuffs could be removed, that the man refused to comply, and that he then explained that force would be have to be used against him. The officer said that he took the decision to take the man to the floor but, as he did so, the man moved and fell to the ground and hit his head on the floor.

Both vehicles pulled over at 9.59pm.\\nWitness and officer accounts indicate that the officers restrained one of the male passengers from the vehicle on the ground. One officer discharged his incapacitant spray before the man was handcuffed. At some stage, the officers saw a number of plastic wraps on the ground near the man’s head. They then realised that he had lost consciousness.\\nOne of the officers contacted the Control Room at 10.05pm to request an ambulance. The request was relayed to the London Ambulance Service at 10.07pm.\\nThe first paramedic arrived at the scene at 10.18pm. On checking the man’s airway, he saw that it was blocked by a number of plastic wraps. Paramedics and hospital staff subsequently removed a number of wraps from the man’s throat, but he remained in a critical condition and died on 21 June 2017. The wraps were tested and found to contain cocaine and heroin.\\nWitnesses alleged that the officers used excessive force to restrain the man. Some stated the officers put pressure on his throat, and continued restraining him after he had lost consciousness. We investigated these allegations. We also considered whether the officers called an ambulance promptly, and whether they provided sufficient and appropriate first aid care to the man. We also looked at one of the officers’ use of incapacitant spray.\\nOur investigators obtained accounts from the five officers who restrained the man, and from a number of other police and non-police witnesses. Investigators also obtained and reviewed mobile phone, CCTV and body-worn camera footage, police radio transmissions and documentary evidence. They also considered relevant policies, guidance and expert opinions.\\nWe considered that the officers’ use of force in the circumstances was reasonable in order to retain control of the situation, including the use of handcuffs.

We considered that this could be considered as a failure for the officer to perform their duties satisfactorily, and should be dealt with by way of management action. We also considered that two other officers could have contacted an ambulance as a priority and did not do so and this be handled through management action.\\nWe also found that one officer had told the control room that the man was conscious and responsive when requesting an ambulance, at a time when the man was in fact unconscious. Although this had no impact on the response time of the ambulance, we were of the view that this mistake should be dealt with by way of management action.\\nWe were of the view that the care provided to the man after incapacitant spray was used and officers’ efforts to try to force the man’s mouth open to check his airway both appeared to be in line with guidance, and that officers had no case to answer in respect of this allegation.\\nWitnesses indicated that one of the officers discharged incapacitant spray at close range – and much closer than the one metre minimum distance in guidelines. We were of the view that one officer had a case to answer for misconduct in respect of the distance from which they deployed incapacitant spray.\\nOur investigation also looked at potential issues of discrimination in this investigation. Although, in our opinion, there was no evidence indicating that officers had discriminated against the man, we found that one officer’s comments about one the witnesses indicated some preconceptions, and that this should be addressed via management action.\\nAfter reviewing our report the MPS agreed with our views, and confirmed that the officers would receive management action as detailed above.\\nWe completed our investigation in July 2018 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded to publish our findings.\\n', 'recsheading': 'Recommendations', 'recommendation': 'The College of Policing should seek expert advice to determine the medical implications of using incapacitant spray when a subject is suspected of having an item in their mouth (that may lead to an obstruction to their airway).

An officer reviewed the incident log and did not escalate it, as they thought from a comment made by one of the radio operators that the incident was going to be allocated imminently. Another officer then made the decision to close the log without police attendance – which is in accordance with force policy – but did not fully record their rationale for doing so.\\nTaking into account the overall situation and the time which had elapsed since the incident in question, we were of the opinion that these had been relatively minor performance issues for one radio operator and two police officers, which could be addressed informally. We completed our investigation in June 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report GMP agreed and advised that the performance issue for the two officers would be dealt with by words of advice from their line managers.

The allegation was that the officer forced the man’s head into a brick wall, resulting in a cut to the man’s head.\\nDuring the course of our investigation we also identified a potential conduct matter relating to the same officer for allegedly failing in their duty to ensure the man was taken directly to hospital following the incident.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the officer under misconduct and criminal caution, examined body-worn video (BWV) footage and obtained statements from several witnesses, including police witnesses and members of the public who were present.\\nThe Investigator formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for the officer for using force that was not proportionate to any potential perceived threat by the man. The Investigator also formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for the officer for not transporting the man directly to custody, when the man did not provide a direct response when asked if he needed an ambulance.\\nWe completed our investigation in September 2017.\\nWe also submitted a file of evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to consider a possible criminal offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\\nAfter reviewing our report the MPS determined in October 2017 that there was inconclusive evidence as to the exact cause of how the man’s injury was sustained and that the officer would attend a gross misconduct hearing for his use of force in relation to the man’s injury. The MPS also advised that the officer would appear in front of a misconduct panel for failing to follow guidance by not transporting the man to hospital after he was injured.\\nIn October 2017 the CPS decided to charge the police officer for common assault.

The panel was also not satisfied that the man had suffered a head injury, but rather a head wound, and was satisfied that the officer had therefore not breached his duty to take the man to hospital.

The suspected drunk driver was said to be in a nearby supermarket.\\nThe PCSOs identified the suspect vehicle in the supermarket car park and, when it was leaving the car park, one of the PCSOs signalled to the driver to stop. The driver did not stop and the PCSOs followed the suspect vehicle, which is said to have driven through red traffic lights and subsequently crashed into a pedestrian.

We completed our investigation in November 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, GMP agreed with our views and arranged for the PCSO to attend a misconduct meeting.\\nAt the meeting, held in summer 2019, misconduct was found not proven by the panel.\\nOur investigation also highlighted a number of areas for improvement for GMP.

They spotted a car being driven in a suspicious manner and ran some checks. They requested the car to stop, but one of the passengers got out of the car and made off on foot, and the suspicious car drove off.\\nOfficers decided to follow the man who had left the car. Two officers gave chase on foot. The man ran into a shop and one of the officers ran behind him. The officer detained the man and took him to the ground. The officer believed the man may be trying to put an item in his mouth that he thought may be drugs, He tried to stop the man from doing so by attempting to control his hands. He asked the man a number of times to spit out what he thought he had swallowed and applied pressure to the man’s jaw.\\nOnce they were both on the ground, the officer handcuffed the man in the rear position with the help of a member of the public and turned the man onto his side. The officer realised the man was having difficulty breathing and requested help from his colleagues. The officer also called for an ambulance.\\nA second officer, who was a trained police medic, arrived, took the handcuffs off the man and started administering first aid. Paramedics arrived and removed a package from the man’s airway. The man was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead 15 minutes after arriving. The post-mortem conducted by the Home Office pathologist recorded the probable cause of death as cardiac arrest caused by upper airway obstruction by foreign body.\\nOur investigators obtained statements from the officers and from members of the public, paramedics and hospital staff. They listened to radio transmissions from police and paramedics and instructed a use of force expert and a survivability expert. Investigators obtained and viewed CCTV from a number of sources, as well as body-worn video footage from the police officers. They also reviewed and analysed records and documentation produced by police, paramedics and hospital staff. They considered applicable force and national policies and guidance.\\nThe officer who restrained the man was notified they were under investigation for a number of allegations, including that they continued to restrain the man after becoming aware he was suffering from a medical emergency, failed to call an ambulance immediately, and continued to restrain the man when believing the man had something in his mouth.\\nBased on the evidence available we were of the opinion that, although use of restraint may have been reasonable, the nature of the restraint had deviated from recognised techniques. We were of the view that the officer’s performance may be considered to be unsatisfactory and should be addressed.\\nEvidence showed that the officer was aware shortly after taking the man to the floor that this was a medical emergency, and called colleagues (one of whom, the officer knew, was a trained police medic) and provided first aid – albeit not in accordance with their training – but did not immediately call for an ambulance, as required by policy. We considered these failings were due to the officer ‘freezing’ due to fatigue and the stressful and highly dynamic nature of the incident, and were not deliberate. We were of the opinion that these failures should be dealt with as unsatisfactory performance.\\nAfter reviewing our report the MPS agreed. The officer received management action.\\nWe completed our investigation in May 2018 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded to publish our findings, in summer 2018.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Use of force and armed policing', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

The woman formed the impression from his conversation that he was talking to a school-aged girl, and was arranging to meet her for the first time in Scotland. The conversation included remarks of a sexual nature, which caused her concern.\\nWhen she got off the train at Bristol Temple Meads Station, she approached two British Transport Police (BTP) officers and informed them of her concerns. One of the officers passed the information to the BTP Control Room, and an officer later checked the train at Cheltenham Spa Station, but could not find the suspect. Officers finally located the man at Birmingham New Street Station and spoke with him. He gave a name (which transpired to be false), and claimed he was meeting his daughter in Scotland. The officers allowed him to continue his journey.\\nSubsequent enquiries established that the suspect was a convicted sex offender, who had given false details to the officers. Further attempts were made to locate the suspect, without success.\\nAt approximately 12.39pm on 5 November 2017, an anonymous caller (later identified as the suspect) informed Police Scotland that a 14-year-old girl had made allegations of sexual abuse. Trained officers and social workers interviewed the girl, and she disclosed that she had engaged in sexual intercourse with the suspect.\\nAt 9.50pm on the same day, Police Scotland officers located and arrested the suspect. He was subsequently convicted of child sex offences and sentenced to four-and-a-half years’ imprisonment.\\nOur investigators obtained accounts from the officers involved, and obtained and reviewed police incident logs, radio transmissions and body-worn camera footage.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that all seven officers involved had made honest mistakes, in good faith, while trying to perform their duties to the best of their abilities. The evidence indicated that they had reflected on their performance and learned from their errors.\\nIn light of the serious consequences of this incident, we recommended that BTP give careful consideration to learning that could be drawn from this incident, and performance action, so that officers fully understand their powers and responsibilities, and the potential for serious harm to ensue if reports of concern are not handled appropriately.\\nWe completed our investigation in December 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, BTP agreed with our findings. The force advised that two officers who had failed to obtain a detailed first account and a contact number from the reporting witness would receive personalised action plans, formalised with their area champions and shared with the Professional Standards Department. One of the two officers left the force, so no further action was taken.\\nThe force also agreed that the two officers who failed to sufficiently probe the suspect or to undertake sufficient checks to confirm his name or address should be given individual action plans to manage their performance and identify clearly the areas of learning. As one of the officers had since resigned from the force, no further action could be taken against them.\\nBTP confirmed that they had already implemented learning from this case during our investigation by launching a sustained campaign and briefing around professional curiosity and seeking greater clarity of information. This included briefings to force control room staff, which were delivered nationally.\\nThe force is also reviewing resourcing in its learning and development department. BTP is planning to pilot a dedicated development unit, where professional and up-skilled development officers will support new officers to enhance their policing experience and practical application of the law. The force confirmed that learning from this incident is utilised during tutor constable training.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['British Transport Police']}\n",

The front seat passenger sustained a serious head injury and was taken to hospital, where their condition was reported as critical.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators reviewed the initial accounts provided by the two officers following the incident and obtained further accounts clarifying a number of points arising from their initial statement.

This affected the information they gathered from the husband and the way the incident was dealt with.\\nLater that evening the incident was reviewed and reclassified as a missing person. Officers went to the man’s home and spoke to him about the circumstances surrounding his wife leaving. Officers searched the house, as well as the local area and parks. They also took a number of actions, including calling local hotels. After being told that a guest of that name was staying there, officers went to a hotel, where they found the woman in one of the rooms. She had taken her own life.\\nDuring our investigation, investigators interviewed the call handler and supervisor under misconduct notice. They also obtained written responses from the attending officers and their sergeant, and reviewed other evidence, including body-worn video, call recordings, the incident report, and relevant policies.\\nWe found some discrepancies in how the call handler and their supervisor recalled the events and their conversation about how the call should be considered.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the call handler and supervisor should have treated the call from the woman’s husband as a high-risk missing person report from the outset. Treating the call as a domestic incident appears to have impacted on the subsequent police response, with some initial focus on investigating a domestic violence matter, rather than progressing a missing person enquiry. We recommended that this should be addressed as performance issues with both members of staff. We concluded our investigation in October 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Cambridgeshire Constabulary agreed that both members of staff would receive management action, linked to learning objectives.

They could not rouse him and reported it to the custody officer, who immediately summoned the custody healthcare professional (HCP) to examine him. The HCP noted the man had a very high pulse rate and dilated pupils and so administered naloxone (a medication used to block the effects of opioids). The man began to show signs of recovery before the paramedics arrived at custody. At approximately 1.30am, he was taken by ambulance to hospital. He made a full recovery and returned to custody at 3.49am the same day. He was later released under investigation in relation to the alleged assault.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators reviewed CCTV footage from the custody suite as well as the custody record. They obtained witness accounts from police officers and staff, and from two independent witnesses present in the custody suite.\\nWe found an initial indication that the custody officer and two police officers may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, and served them with notices of investigation. All three co-operated with the investigation and provided detailed written accounts outlining their rationale for their decisions and actions.\\nAt the conclusion of the investigation we were of the opinion that none of the officers had a case to answer for misconduct, but that two of the officers would benefit from receiving management action with regard to their supervision of the detainee. We concluded our investigation in April 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Northumbria Police agreed with our findings.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Death and serious injury', 'Northumbria Police']}\n",

The first was following a request from South East Coast Ambulance Service after they had received reports of fighting at the man’s home. The second call was from the man reporting that a second man was being abusive and refusing to leave his home. Kent Police received a further call reporting a disturbance coming from the same address later on in the evening. Kent police officers did not attend this call. Kent Police received a fourth call from the man, who said he had killed the second man whom he had earlier reported for being abusive. Police officers attended and the second man was subsequently taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead the next day.\\nOur investigators attended the post-incident procedure and viewed the officers’ body-worn video footage. All police officers and staff involved provided statements. Investigators also listened to all calls made to Kent Police and to the radio transmissions between the control room and the officers who attended.\\nEvidence indicated that, when officers attended the first time, the paramedics were tending to the (second) man and had no concerns about him. Officers stated they had no legal powers to remove him, and the man who lived there did not appear to present a threat to him.\\nWhen officers arrived for the second time the (second) man appeared to be asleep. They asked the occupier to let the man sleep on his sofa as there was nowhere they could take him. This was in line with force policy, which states that officers should not leave a drunk and incapable person unattended, and try and arrange for someone such as a relative or friend to take responsibility for the person.\\nThe third call from a neighbour was graded as ‘immediate’, but was downgraded, as previous call logs showed that officers had been to the property twice and the (second) man was asleep on both occasions. This action was in line with force policy.\\nWe found that the man’s death could not have been foreseen, and there was nothing to indicate to either the call handlers or the attending officers that the home’s occupier would harm the (second) man.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe concluded our investigation in November 2018 but waited until criminal proceedings were completed before publishing the outcomes of our investigation.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Kent Police']}\n",

The man disclosed he had mental health issues and had stopped taking related medication, and was also using drugs.\\nThe man was initially placed under ‘level 3’, constant observations, to include physical checks and visits to his cell at least every 30 minutes and constant\\xa0 CCTV monitoring.\\nThe man was seen by a healthcare practitioner, who recommended he be put under ‘level 1’, general observation (requiring checks at least every hour with minimal intrusion), and advised he should be monitored for symptoms of hyper/hypoglycaemia such as sweats, excessive thirst, confusion, disorientation, vomiting. The man was not given insulin in custody because he refused to eat. His blood sugar levels were monitored and found to be high, but within the acceptable margins.\\nOn the evening of 29 May 2018, the man was transferred to a mental health unit under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Following his arrival, his blood sugar level continued to rise until it was dangerously high. He was taken by ambulance to Bristol Royal Infirmary, where he received treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis; a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes.\\nOur investigators analysed CCTV footage and compared the contents to information recorded on the custody record. They obtained statements from healthcare professionals and custody staff involved in the man’s care.\\nWhile we identified a number of concerns in relation to the care provided to the man, there were no indications suggesting that any individual acted intentionally or maliciously.

The officers stopped the vehicle, removed the belt from the man and called for an ambulance.

The police officers involved in arresting and transporting the man provided witness statements, and the police vehicle used was inspected.\\nEvidence indicated that the police officers who interacted with the man undertook appropriate risk assessments and took actions to manage and reduce the risks they identified, including by searching and handcuffing him prior to placing him in a police vehicle. They tasked an officer with monitoring the man during transit to safeguard his welfare, as required by the relevant policies.

This included providing guidance/refresher training to officers regarding transporting detainees to highlight the need to act to optimise their view of the detainee when monitoring them to ensure their safety.

During the course of the investigation, electronic devices were taken from the man and examined. Indecent images of children were found on the devices. The images were considered ‘borderline’ and no further action was taken against the man. The devices were returned to him.\\nIn 2017, another young girl alleged sexual abuse against the same man. When investigating this offence, Norfolk Police found devices in the man’s possession that contained indecent images of children. A number of these items had been examined as part of the 2012 Essex Police investigation.\\nThis matter came to our attention in February 2018 as a conduct referral. During our investigation, our investigators interviewed the officer in charge of the case in the 2012 investigation, as well as their supervisor, under misconduct caution. We looked at whether the officer in charge of the case in 2012 had failed to appropriately investigate the alleged offences in 2012, and had returned to the man items which shouldn’t have been returned to him, and whether their supervisor had failed to adequately supervise the investigation.\\nOur investigators obtained witness statements from two other officers regarding their involvement. Investigators also asked questions about the procedure and workload experienced at the time. The electronic devices seized as part of the 2012 investigation were examined further.\\nOur investigation found that the officer in charge initially graded the images as ‘borderline’. The officer said they hadn’t been trained in grading images, though they didn’t flag this with a senior colleague. Our view was that the officer’s failure to seek support for gaps in their training meant that supervisors were unaware, and therefore did not mitigate risks to the completeness of the investigation. We were of the opinion that this may be considered as misconduct, but suggested this could best be dealt with by management action.\\nEvidence indicated that the officer’s supervisor reviewed the case on at least two separate occasions, and based their direction on the initial assessment of the officer in charge. We were therefore of the opinion that the supervisor had no case to answer.\\nWe completed our investigation in January 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Essex Police did not agree that the officer in charge had a case to answer for misconduct for failing to appropriately investigate the allegations. They considered the investigative actions taken by the officer, their apparent lack of experience and training, and the lack of clarity and direction by the various line managers regarding next steps. As a number of reforms and reviews of the force’s Child Abuse investigation teams (CAITs) had taken place in 2012 and 2015, resulting in increased capacity of experienced child abuse investigators, they considered that no further action was needed.\\nThey did agree, however, that the officer had a case to answer for a failure in duties and responsibilities for returning to the man the computer containing indecent images of children. Their view was that this would be best dealt with through management action.\\nAfter considering their views, we agreed that their proposals were appropriate.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Child sexual abuse', 'Essex Police']}\n",

On arrival, she claimed to have taken 30 Valium and 30 ‘pregabs’ (believed to be pregabalin) prior to her arrest. A nurse examined the woman and concluded she was fit to be detained on level three constant observations. Detention officers conducted cell checks at 5.11pm, 5.43pm and 6.21pm. On each occasion detention officers described the woman as “difficult to rouse”. At approximately 7pm, a custody officer and detention officer from the oncoming shift found the woman unconscious and unresponsive in her cell. The woman received medical assistance at the custody suite before being taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where she was placed on a ventilator and transferred to ICU. She was brought out of an induced coma the next day and subsequently discharged from hospital.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators reviewed CCTV footage from the custody suite as well as the woman’s custody record. They obtained witness accounts from police officers and police staff. The investigator found an indication a nurse, a custody officer and two detention officers may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, served them with notices of investigation and subsequently interviewed the custody officer and detention officers under the misconduct caution. All four co-operated with the investigation and provided detailed rationale for their decisions and actions.\\nEvidence indicated that, at the time the nurse assessed the woman in the holding cell, the woman was not displaying signs of an overdose. However, the nurse considered that the woman was at a heightened level of risk, requiring constant monitoring via CCTV and rousing every 30 minutes.\\nWe were of the opinion that the custody officer may have a case to answer for misconduct for not taking action when the detention officers advised the woman was “difficult to rouse”. We were also of the opinion that neither detention officer had complied with professional guidance on the rousing of detainees on level three constant observations. We were also of the opinion that the first detention officer would benefit from management action to remind them of the importance of complying with this guidance and that the second detention officer had a case to answer. We completed our investigation in October 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Northumbria Police agreed. At a misconduct meeting, a case to answer was found against one of the detention officers, who received a verbal warning and additional training. A case to answer for misconduct was not found against the custody officer; their performance was, however, found to have been unsatisfactory.

Other custody staff sounded an alarm when they saw the custody detention officer restraining the man and a number of officers present in the custody suite entered the cell to assist.\\nThe man later complained of soreness to his ribs and was seen by a custody nurse. He was prescribed pain relief tablets. The following morning the man complained again of soreness to his ribs and of having difficulty breathing, but refused to see a second custody nurse. The man was transferred to court and then to a local prison by staff from a police contractor. The man made an allegation to prison staff that he had been assaulted while in police custody. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was found to have three fractured ribs and a collapsed lung. He was admitted to hospital for treatment for four days, before he was returned to prison.\\nIn February 2017 the man formally complained to Merseyside Police that he had been assaulted during his restraint by the custody detention officer who had first entered his cell, that he had been verbally abused by him, that he had been denied medical treatment and that the staff member who had taken him to court had threatened him in his police cell.\\nThe force referred this matter to us in March 2017.\\nDuring our investigation, we obtained accounts from all staff and officers who had contact with the man during his period in custody, including the custody nurses. We reviewed CCTV footage from the custody suite along with all documentation related to the man’s stay in custody. We interviewed the man regarding his complaint. We also interviewed the custody detention officer under criminal caution.

We found that there was limited evidence to explain how the injuries were sustained. The cell the man was detained in had no CCTV. The accounts of the man and of the detention officer conflict in part – although both are consistent in agreeing that the detention officer took hold of the man’s hands/wrists.

The medical expert’s opinion was that the injury was ‘highly consistent’ with the detention officer kneeling or leaning over the man with his weight on his chest or throwing his weight on his chest.\\nWe were of the opinion that it was for a panel to determine which of the two credible conflicting accounts they preferred and to decide whether, on the balance of probabilities, the detention officer may have a case to answer for gross misconduct for using the force which resulted in the man sustaining three fractured ribs and a punctured lung, and may also have a case to answer for misconduct for using derogatory language when dealing with the man. We completed our investigation in May 2018.\\nWe also submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), to consider allegations that the detention officer may have committed an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. After examining the evidence, the CPS decided not to prosecute. The man exercised his right to a review of the evidence, and the CPS concluded again that there was no case.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Merseyside Police was of the view that the officer had no case to answer for the allegations.\\nWe recommended that they proceed with a gross misconduct hearing, which the force agreed to hold.\\nAt the gross misconduct hearing, held in spring 2019, the chair found that the officer had no case to answer.

The evidence indicated there was no justification to carry out a strip search.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nThe investigation showed that one officer did not search the man’s socks or used a metal detector to search him, which was against GMP policy. Although there was no evidence that this failure had caused or contributed to the man’s death, we were of the opinion that the officer would benefit from being reminded of the GMP policy and of their obligations when carrying out a search of a detained person.\\nAfter reviewing our report GMP agreed, and advised that the officer would be made aware of our report and findings for information.\\nWe concluded our investigation in June 2018 but waited until the inquest into the man’s death had concluded in spring 2019 before publishing its outcome.

Two police officers were in the vehicle, a driver and an operator, and the vehicle had its blue lights activated, but not its sirens. At approximately 6.14am, the police vehicle began overtaking traffic when approaching the brow of a hill. The police vehicle drove into the opposite lane to do this. A member of the public, who was riding a motorbike in the opposite direction, rode over the top of the hill and, on seeing the police vehicle in his lane and coming towards him, applied his brakes, skidded and came off the motorbike. The police vehicle stopped at the scene and the motorbike rider was taken to hospital by ambulance with serious injuries.

Due to the threat to the public and other road users, GMP devised a tactical plan to deal with this vehicle, involving unmarked police vehicles, in order to avoid a pursuit. This Ford Focus was seen stationary by officers in an unmarked police patrol. When the officers approached on foot, the driver attempted to drive away but crashed into a wall. Officers noted the vehicle was missing a front tyre and that the driver continued attempting to drive despite its condition. Police officers arrested the driver for dangerous driving and other offences. During the arrest, the driver was struck with a police baton, sprayed with incapacitant (CS) spray and Tasered. As he was removed from the vehicle, officers saw that he was on fire and attempted to put out the flames. The driver sustained burns to his chest and neck area, and a broken arm.\\nDuring the investigation we took statements from the officers involved, obtained data download from the Taser, and collected and examined CCTV footage. Our investigators also examined relevant policies and enhanced and analysed body-worn video footage.\\nWe interviewed the two officers involved under caution in relation to the force used when they arrested the driver.\\nWhen considering all the available evidence, we were of the opinion that, when the officers decided to us incapacitant spray, baton strikes and Taser to restrain the man, they were facing a dangerous and determined criminal who was trying to avoid apprehension. The officer who discharged the Taser stated he was aware of the potential combined effect of CS spray and Taser, but did not know that the other officer had used CS spray. We were of the view that, in the challenging circumstances that they faced, the officers’ use of force was proportionate and justified.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence. We concluded our investigation in October 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report GMP agreed.

Her ex-partner spoke to the control room operator and said he wanted to report that the woman had been the victim of a serious offence. Police officers were dispatched and spoke separately to the woman and her ex-partner, but the woman said she did not want to report the offence. Police completed a domestic abuse risk assessment and made a referral to a third party support agency.\\nIn the following months, a number of contacts were made with Staffordshire Police by various parties, expressing concern for the woman. A support agency made contact with Staffordshire Police in October 2016 expressing concern about the number of contacts the woman was receiving from her ex-partner.\\nThe woman was placed in a refuge in Cleveland in October 2016. She had contact with police in October, expressing concern for her ex-husband, as her ex-partner was making threats against him. Staffordshire Police also received contact from Cleveland Police, expressing concern that the woman’s ex-partner was trying to locate her.\\nThe woman obtained a non-molestation order (NMO) against her ex-partner in November 2016.\\nThe woman reported three breaches of the NMO during November. She also reported that her ex-partner had attempted to get messages to her via third parties and harassed her via social media.\\nThe woman, her ex-husband and her adult son, as well as a friend, all reported unsolicited contact from her ex-partner during December 2016 and January 2017. The woman also reported malicious emails being sent to her ex-husband.\\nThe woman attempted suicide in January 2017. Police were alerted to this after her ex-husband contacted them to say he had been unable to get in touch with her.\\nThe woman’s ex-partner was arrested in February 2017, but was released on bail. The woman contacted police on 4 February 2017 to report a further breach of the NMO.\\nTwo of the woman’s friends, having been unable to contact her, went to her house on 22 February. She was found dead from hanging. Her ex-partner was subsequently arrested and charged with harassment, coercive and controlling behaviour in an intimate or family relationship, and manslaughter. He pleaded guilty to the charges against him in July 2017.\\nStaffordshire Police referred this matter to the IOPC as a ‘death and serious injury’ referral on 28 February 2017. Subsequently, a friend of the woman and a member of her family separately complained about the way Staffordshire Police had handled various contacts with the woman in the run-up to her death. This additional referral was sent to us in March 2017.\\nWe examined documentation from 34 connected contacts by the woman or her ex-partner which had been made with police between September 2016 and February 2017. This included police incident logs and crime records, statements given by the woman and various other parties, domestic abuse risk assessments and multi-agency documentation. We obtained statements from the complainants, police witnesses and other people who knew the woman. We conducted a detailed analysis of every police interaction with the woman, her friends and her family.\\nWe analysed the actions of all the police officers and police staff members against policies, guidance, other accounts, and the police standards of professional behaviour relevant to their roles.\\nWe were of the opinion there was an indication that an officer may have behaved in a manner which justified the bringing of disciplinary proceedings. This was because they had taken a decision not to arrest the woman’s ex-partner when he was in breach of his non-molestation order, after assessing that the woman appeared to have gone out willingly with him. Additionally, a number of complaints were raised about incivility and advice given that caused evidence to be lost, which related specifically to this officer.\\nThat officer retired from Staffordshire Police in March 2018. However, the investigation found that their performance had been unsatisfactory in making the decision not to arrest the woman’s ex-partner.\\nA number of issues were also identified as unsatisfactory performance for other officers. This included a failure to record a crime; a failure to take appropriate steps following an application for disclosure under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme; a number of failures to complete mandatory domestic abuse risk assessments with the woman; and a failure to adequately recognise a breach of the NMO.\\nIn total, the investigation made recommendations that seven officers and one member of police staff should receive management action.\\nWe were also of the opinion that there had been inconsistencies in when incidents and crimes were linked on police systems. This had made it more difficult for staff and officers to appreciate the nature and scale of the ex-partner’s offending. Similarly, there had been a failure to consistently conduct lateral research and checks when incidents were reported. We recommended that this should be addressed by way of immediate training for all staff in the call centre environment.\\nWe completed our investigation in February 2019.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Staffordshire Police agreed with our opinions and recommendations, and confirmed that all eight officers and police staff would receive management action. The force also agreed to carry out training in line with our recommendations.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Staffordshire Police']}\n",

An incident log was created and graded at level 2, but at 9.35am, another officer downgraded it to a 4 with a direction for social services to be called, as it was not a police matter.\\nAt 4.29pm, the log was updated: social services had been contacted and had said they had no record of the named woman living at the address. Social services asked the police to make enquiries at the address then make a referral to their out-of-hours team.\\nOn 3 March, at 3.26pm, the log was reviewed and regraded as a 2, with an instruction to re-contact the initial caller for further details, and for officers to attend to conduct a welfare check if this failed.

When police officers arrived, the woman told one of them that her son was alcohol-dependant and had been drinking a bottle of whisky throughout the previous night, and was refusing to get up. She said she wanted him to leave her home and find alternative accommodation.\\nThe officers spoke to the man and asked him to leave, but he was unwilling or unable to respond to the officers’ instructions. The man was arrested for a breach of the peace and handcuffed were applied. As the man was physically unresponsive, the officers carried him out of the house and into a police van, so he could be taken to the local police station. However, en route, the officers realised the man was unwell and drove him to hospital instead. The man received treatment for hypoxia (deficiency in oxygen) and was placed in an induced coma for approximately 48 hours.\\nDuring our investigation we interviewed the woman and obtained a statement from her. The man also provided a statement. We carried out house-to-house enquiries and checked for any relevant CCTV evidence. We seized and examined police body-worn video (BWV) footage, as well as police audio and written communications, regarding this incident.\\nOur investigators also interviewed the four police officers who had attended the scene and dealt with the man under notice that their conduct was under investigation.\\nWe found that one of the officers had obtained information about the man’s medical condition from his mother (captured by BWV) but had not passed it on to the other officers who arrived afterwards. The man’s condition deteriorated rapidly, leading officers to believe he was feigning illness. None of the officers appeared to comply with police guidance which says that anyone who is ‘drunk and incapable’, unconscious or suffering from any other medical condition requiring urgent attention should be taken straight to hospital.\\nThree of the officers had failed to turn on their BWV during the incident, and one of the officers turned it on and off throughout the incident, which was not in line with policy\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the performance of three officers had been unsatisfactory for failing to turn on their BWV and taking the man straight to hospital, as per guidance. We also found that the performance of the officer who had not passed on valuable information about the man’s condition to colleagues had also been unsatisfactory.\\nWe found that the fourth officer, who took the decision to drive the man to hospital when realising he was unwell in the police van, had acted appropriately in the circumstances. We completed our investigation in September 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, West Yorkshire Police agreed that all three officers would receive management action, to include words of advice regarding communicating information, guidance when dealing with persons considered to be ‘drunk and incapable’, and force policy on the use of BWV.\\nThe investigation highlighted a lack of awareness in officers of the guidance regarding dealing with members of the public who may be intoxicated.

She also said her ex-husband had been harassing her since she had last spoken to police. The evidence suggested the call handler failed to obtain details of this further harassment, instead updating the original harassment crime record. The call handler also closed the criminal damage file because there was no evidence to suggest it was the woman’s ex-husband who had caused the damage.\\nOn 10 March 2018, the woman returned to the police station and made a full statement, stating she wished to support police action. Her case was passed to an investigator.\\nOn 16 March 2018, Sussex Police received a 999 call from the woman’s sister, who said that the woman’s ex-husband had fired shots at the property the woman shared with her family. During this incident, the man shot and killed the woman and her mother.\\nOur investigators obtained and analysed a large number of documents, reports and statements. We investigated allegations that the call handler had failed to recognise the further harassment, and inappropriately downgraded the incident. Our investigators interviewed the call handler, who answered all questions.\\nOur investigators also interviewed the call handler’s supervisor and the officers who were involved in the police investigations, and obtained statements from other call handlers who had spoken to the woman on the phone.\\nThe actions of all the police officers and police staff members were analysed against policies, guidance, other accounts, and the police standards of professional behaviour relevant to their roles.\\nAt the end of the investigation, based on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the call handler may have a case to answer for misconduct for failing to complete a list of actions set by their supervisor, and for failing to record the additional allegations of harassment made by the woman, and had therefore breached standards of professional behaviour ‘instructions’ and ‘work and responsibilities’. We completed our investigation in December 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Sussex Police agreed the call handler should attend a misconduct meeting. At a disciplinary meeting held in early 2019 the allegation against the call handler was found proven, with the call handler receiving management advice.\\nOur investigation also highlighted areas of learning for Sussex Police around reviewing training for officers and staff when using a stalking risk assessment tool and completing risk assessment questionnaires. The force agreed to review relevant areas.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Sussex Police']}\n",

Two officers saw a group matching the description of the gang members and approached them to conduct a stop and search. The group attempted to run away.

This was part of a wider initiative to combat gang crime in the city. A photograph of the main suspect was circulated beforehand to officers taking part in the operation.\\nThe main suspect was spotted in an alleyway on foot along with another man. Two armed officers they were walking towards drew their weapons and gave commands for the men to stop and show their hands. One of the men (the main suspect) complied immediately, but the other man held his hand slightly behind him and towards the rear of his body. Believing the man to have a weapon he was about to use, one of the officers shot the man in the chest.\\nOfficers gave the man immediate first aid and called an ambulance. The man was taken to hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove a single bullet from his chest.The man, who was unarmed, subsequently complained that he had been the main target for the police and that the police intent was to shoot him.\\xa0 He further alleged that he had been stripped naked by the officers and not received any first aid.\\nWe investigated the circumstances in which the shooting took place. Our investigators were deployed to the scene and attended the post-incident procedure. They gathered and reviewed police body-worn video (BWV) that captured footage of the incident. Investigators also carried out house-to- house enquiries and collected relevant evidence, including ballistics analysis. They obtained statements from all officers involved in the operation, including the firearms officer who fired the shot, and from independent witnesses. In addition they looked at the firearms authorisations of the officers involved and reviewed police radio transmissions.\\nThe officer who fired the shot stated that the man was not complying with the commands that were being given to him, in that he did not put his hands up into the air when asked to do so. He said that the man appeared to draw his right hand away from his body, and made a motion with his hand, as if to point what the officer believed was a gun towards the two officers. It was at this point that the officer discharged one round to ‘neutralise the threat’ he felt the man presented. The officer stated that he did not believe he had had viable alternative options – such as, for instance, Taser – due to the immediacy of the potential threat posed.\\nEvidence showed that the firearms officer fired a single shot. Footage from the two officers’ BWV confirmed that the man did not immediately comply to raise his hands and appeared to be reaching behind his back just before the shot was fired. Intelligence provided to the officers was that gang members usually carried weapons tucked into the rear of their trousers.\\nOur investigation found that all police officers involved, including the one who fired the shot, acted in line with policy and procedure.\\nHaving reviewed the evidence, including all statements, the intelligence brief provided to officers before the operation, and officers’ BWV footage, we were of the opinion that the man’s actions could have led the officer to believe that the man was a threat. We were therefore of the view that the officer’s actions were appropriate in the circumstances.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nBWV footage obtained during our investigation showed that, immediately after the shot was fired, the officers present began to source and administer first aid to the man. One officer is seen to be cutting the man’s shirt with scissors in order to place a chest seal on his wound. Officers are shown to be staying with the man until the ambulance arrived.\\nEvidence we gathered indicated that the man who was shot was not identified by police until after he left the scene and was being treated in hospital. During the planning of the police operation he had not been named as a suspect or expected to be present.\\nWe therefore did not uphold the man’s complaints that he had been targeted by police, denied first aid, or in any other way mistreated by officers.\\nAfter reviewing our report, WMP agreed with our findings.\\nOur investigation was finalised in March 2018 but discussions around sensitive police operational details and other relevant factors have delayed publication of our findings until now.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Use of force and armed policing', 'West Midlands Police']}\n",

He also raised concerns about the man’s mental health. Police officers attended the mosque and spoke with the man. They did not identify any mental health issues, nor that he had committed any crime. The officers then took the man back to his home, and later completed a referral to social services.\\nOn 22 March, a GP contacted WYP regarding concerns one of their patients had raised about her son’s mental health. The GP reported that the same man was currently at the mosque. Officers attended and spoke with the man. They did not identify any mental health issues, nor that he had committed any crime. Paramedics also spoke with the man and they did not identify any mental health issues. The man was then allowed to leave the mosque.\\nOn 25 March, the man attended the same mosque and stabbed a member of the congregation. Police subsequently arrested the man.\\nWYP referred this matter to us in November 2017. The man’s mother made a complaint about WYP’s response to the concerns she had raised about her son, which was referred to us in May 2018. We investigated both at the same time.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained and reviewed police logs and WYP policies and procedures. All WYP officers who had interacted with the man were treated as witnesses and provided witness statements. Investigators reviewed Airwave communications, logs, telephone calls and body-worn video from the four incidents. They also obtained statements from medical professionals and other witnesses involved in the incidents.\\nEvidence indicated that WYP arranged for the man’s mental health to be assessed while he was in custody, and also facilitated an assessment by two paramedics when they attended the mosque on 22 March. The medical professionals in these two instances did not identify any concerns with the man’s mental health.\\xa0\\nWe were satisfied that the officers’ decisions not to detain the man under S136 of the Mental Health Act were appropriate when they interacted with him: none of the evidence presented to the officers at the relevant times would have given them reason or justification to detain him. A significant number of WYP officers interacted with the man over the four instances and none of them expressed any concerns for his mental health. WYP took some positive action in terms of initiating safeguarding measures: they completed a DASH (domestic abuse, stalking, harassment and honour-based abuse) risk assessment, and submitted a referral to Social Services, both of which were appropriate in the circumstances.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe completed our investigation in January 2019.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'West Yorkshire Police']}\n",

Throughout the day, members of the public made a number of calls to Hampshire Constabulary reporting the group had left their ponies and traps in the road, while the ponies were also causing damage to the roadside. This resulted in police officers attending the scene and speaking to the group. Information was obtained that suggested the travellers would continue to drink into the evening, as they were due to attend a party in another area of Southampton.\\nFrom 9.01pm until 10.49pm, a further nine calls were made by members of the public to Hampshire Constabulary. They reported a group of Travellers racing ponies and traps along Portsmouth Road, potentially under the influence of alcohol, in addition to causing obstructions to other motorists. No police officers were deployed to the scene in response to these calls.\\nAt 11.30pm, Hampshire Constabulary received a call reporting that a person who had been driving a horse and cart along Portsmouth Road had been involved in a fatal road traffic collision. The caller said that the person had been driving his pony and trap along an unlit section of Portsmouth Road and had been struck from behind by a car travelling in the same direction.\\nDuring the investigation we obtained accounts from Senior Management within the control room and control room staff. We served three members of police staff with notices that they were under investigation for potential breaches of the standards of professional behaviour in relation to closing incident logs, failing to escalate the incident, failing to record a rationale when closing incident logs, and failing to ensure the incident was adequately resolved. All three provided a response to the allegations detailed in their notices.\\nWe examined relevant national and local policies and legislation, including training documentation. We obtained and examined the incident logs for the day when the incident occurred, as well as transcripts of the calls made by members of the public.\\nBased on the evidence available, at the end of the investigation, we were of the opinion that the three members of staff in the control room had not breached the standards of professional behaviour, but that their performance may be considered to be unsatisfactory. We recommended that they receive management action.\\nAfter reviewing our report Hampshire Constabulary agreed that all three would receive management action so that they are aware of how their actions fell short and modify their conduct in the future. The force also commented that the policies and procedures which should support effective decision making and the recording of the rationale for such decisions appeared not to be robust enough, and that they would ensure that these are rectified.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Road traffic incidents', 'Hampshire Constabulary']}\n",

We consulted expert witnesses to determine whether the driver had followed both the training and policies correctly.\\nThe collision report stated that the damage to the police vehicle was to the offside headlamp area. This was consistent with the reports of the police driver and passenger, who said that the man had emerged from behind a stationary vehicle on the offside, and collided with the offside of the vehicle.

The man had last collected his methadone prescription on 19 February 2018 and this was described as out of character.\\xa0 He said that the man’s phone was initially ringing out, but it now appeared switched off.\\nThis was initially graded as a ‘grade 2’, requiring a response within one hour of the call. The radio operator escalated this log to the attention of a sergeant as they were unable to allocate any resource due to ongoing higher-priority incidents. Shortly after, a sergeant noted on the incident log that this didn’t appear to be a police matter, and that the caller should be advised to make basic enquiries themselves and call the police again if necessary.\\nGMP contacted the support worker again, who gave similar information as previously, and said that he had been to the man’s home and there had been no answer, but some lights were on. GMP did not escalate the matter at this point and the incident was delayed for a number of hours as no patrols were available.\\nAt 12.38am on 23 February, officers gained entry to the man’s home and found him dead in his kitchen. At an inquest held later into the man’s death the Coroner determined that the man had died of combined drug toxicity.\\nOur investigators commissioned an overview report examining the handling of the log, obtained statements from the officers and police staff involved, and took statements from the Operations Control Branch staff involved.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that there was no evidence that any officer has misconducted themselves to such an extent that disciplinary proceedings would be warranted. We considered that a number of radio operators had breached force policy when they did not escalate this matter to supervision. We suggested this should be dealt with by way of performance for the individuals and a wider learning point for the force. We completed our investigation in December 2018.\\nAfter reviewing our report, GMP’s view was that, although there had been no performance issue warranting unsatisfactory performance procedures, the radio operators had not taken sufficient and reasonable steps to escalate the incident in line with concerns around the man’s vulnerabilities. The delay in going to the man’s home due to lack of available resources also highlighted a wider learning issue for the force. GMP proposed to deal with this through management advice for the radio operators. GMP also advised that Operations Control Branch staff’s understanding of vulnerability would be reviewed, and that staff would receive refresher training around escalation policy and procedures.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Greater Manchester Police']}\n",

One officer checked on the man, found him in the foetal position on the floor, established he was still responsive and decided to leave him in that position. They continued driving the man to custody. On the way, the officers were diverted to another police station. On arrival the man remained in the van while one of the officers arranged for the man to be booked in custody. When officers opened the door of the police van they found the man was unresponsive.

In addition, we were of the view that one of the officers may have a case to answer for misconduct for failing in their duty of care towards the man after he fell on the floor in the van on the way to custody, and deciding to leave the man in a foetal position.

Concerned that she hadn’t returned home after going out the night before, the woman’s father had visited a police station twice during the night (at 1.35am and 4.59am) and had spoken to police staff on an intercom – the second call was cut off. The woman’s mother then called the police at approximately 5.30am to report her as missing, and explained that she had a mental health condition and may harm herself. The call handler graded this as a ‘medium’ priority missing person report.\\nTwo officers went to the parents’ home around 6am to take details and search for information that may help to locate her. Police made a number of enquiries to try and find the woman. After receiving information that she had expressed suicidal thoughts recently, the risk was reassessed and increased to ‘high’ before midday. A trace on the woman’s mobile phone gave the location of a hotel. Officers made enquiries there, but nobody recognised her. At approximately 1pm, hotel staff found the woman dead in one of the rooms.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed police officers, police staff and members of the woman’s family. They also examined police records and voice recordings. We served two call handlers with notices that their actions were under investigation.\\nBased on the evidence available, at the end of the investigation, we were of the opinion that the two call handlers who had responded to the woman’s father’s intercom calls may have a case to answer for misconduct for breaching the standards of professional behaviour: the first call handler for not gathering sufficient information from him to be able to risk assess the circumstances around his daughter’s absence and for not creating an incident log, which would have required further details to be obtained; the second call handler for not creating an incident log and not conducting further intelligence checks, and not making contact with the woman’s mother on her mobile when the intercom call cut off.

Officers located it at around midday, hidden in a forest. NYP planned an operation to arrest the suspects when they returned to collect the quad bike.\\nAt approximately 2.40pm, a vehicle containing three people arrived to recover the quad bike. The vehicle and the quad bike left the scene and were kept under observation by two officers in an unmarked transit van. They lost sight of the quad bike en route to the A66.\\nA number of officers stopped the vehicle and arrested the two occupants. The quad bike was seen again by officers, who maintained observations from the transit van. Plans were made to deploy a stinger (tyre deflation device) in order to prevent a pursuit developing. A police helicopter was also observing the quad bike. As the bike was heading in the direction of the Durham Constabulary force area, NYP notified the Durham Constabulary control room.\\nThe stinger was deployed. However, the quad bike evaded it and a pursuit developed, involving three NYP vehicles. During the pursuit, significant issues were experienced with the communication channels. Eventually these were resolved. As the quad bike rode through the village of Ingleton, a Durham Constabulary police car was approaching from the opposite direction.

They obtained witness statements from one of the attending officers and from the woman’s husband.\\nDuring the investigation, we served the member of police staff who worked within the ART with a notice informing them that their conduct was under investigation, for not making an onward referral, which may have resulted in a failure to appropriately safeguard the woman. We received a written response from them following this notice.\\nWe were of the opinion that, at the time when the member of police staff made their decision not to request an onward referral, they made an assessment based on the information received from the attending officers. This information did not raise any concerns, in their mind, that further action was required. The member of staff appears to have considered the issues in accordance with applicable policies. We were satisfied that the member of staff considered whether contact with further agencies was required and decided it was not.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nWe completed our investigation in July 2018.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Leicestershire Police']}\n",

The caller said they and their family had left their flat in fear for their safety. The man had attended a party at the flat earlier that night, but this information was not provided during the 999 call, and therefore could not be passed on to the police officers who responded.\\nTwo Staffordshire Police officers, who were both Taser officers, arrived at approximately 1.13am and established that the man had barricaded himself in a room of the flat. They were joined by two more police officers: a police sergeant and a police dog handler (who was also a Taser officer). The police officers entered the flat and spoke to the man, but were unsuccessful in persuading him to leave the room. The door to the room the man was barricaded in was shut with a sofa.\\nAt 1.28am the police dog handler forced entry into the living room with his police dog. The man struck the dog, causing it to retreat to the communal stairwell. The police officer retrieved the police dog, drew his Taser and re-entered the room. A physical struggle occurred, during which the police officer discharged his Taser. The Taser connected with the man and was energised four times. The police dog bit the man’s arm and leg. When the physical struggle stopped, the man was conscious and lying on his back.\\nThe other police officers then entered the room and arrested the man for burglary and assault. Officers handcuffed him, initially with his hands at the front, and subsequently with his hands at the rear. He said he had taken drugs, but didn’t know which ones, and that he was there for a party. Officers attempted to calm the man down and said they would arrange medical assistance if he needed it.\\nThe man was helped out of the flat, down the stairs and into the cage at the back of a police van at 1.46am. One officer stayed near the van to monitor the man while the other officers returned to the flat to collect evidence.\\nThe man became unresponsive. Other officers arrived and opened the cage door. They could not detect the man’s pulse. Officers requested an ambulance and commenced cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The ambulance arrived at 2.05am. The man was placed in the back of the ambulance and CPR continued. The man was pronounced dead while in the rear of the ambulance at 2.30am.\\nDuring the course of the investigation, our investigators served notices on six Staffordshire Police officers who were involved in the incident, advising them that their conduct was subject of our investigation.\\xa0\\nWe considered numerous lines of enquiry including whether officers:\\nOur investigation found that officers were concerned that the man was a possible risk to himself as well as others, and that officers did attempt to calm the man down by using verbal communication prior to using force. We also found that use of force, including use of a Taser and deployment of a police dog, was necessary, legitimate and proportionate in the circumstances.\\nWe completed our investigation in August 2016. We recommended gross misconduct for three officers for the failure to treat the man as a medical emergency at the point of his arrest, to request timely emergency medical assistance for him, and for the delay in seeking medical help after he was placed in a police van.\\xa0\\nIn September 2016 we referred three officers to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for a charging decision in relation to criminal offences. The CPS decided in February 2017 that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against any of the officers.\\nA disciplinary hearing arranged by Staffordshire Police was held before an Independent Chair in September 2017. One officer was cleared of gross misconduct, and the panel found misconduct for the remaining two officers. The two officers later successfully appealed the outcome.\\nBased on our recommendation, Staffordshire Police agreed to consider training officers on recognition of medical emergencies.\\nWe also made recommendations leading to Staffordshire Police agreeing to implement policies and training including:\\nThe inquest into the man’s death took place in winter 2018. The jury returned a narrative conclusion which gave the cause of death as the effects of cocaine and the stress of the incident. The jury said that misinformation given to police when they were called affected their decisions and the level of force used, which was “a significant factor” in the stress caused to the man.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Death and serious injury', 'Staffordshire Police']}\n",

A number of WMP officers had arrived at the property on 24 August 2017 to arrest a man. When they arrived, the man was not there, but they spoke to three persons who were present (none of whom was wanted by the police). During the interaction, one of the three occupants filmed the officers on their mobile phone, initially without the officers being aware of this. On the footage, one of the officers can be heard making inappropriate comments of a discriminatory nature.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the officers and the persons present in the searched property, and examined relevant force documentation. We served four officers with notices informing them that their actions were under investigation. Investigators also reviewed footage from the incident.\\nOur investigation found evidence that the officer made the comments in front of a fellow officer, who failed to challenge or report the inappropriate behaviour.\\nWe also obtained evidence showing that a supervising officer had failed in their duties and responsibilities, namely failing to ensure force records were noted of the search or entry to a property.\\nBased on the evidence available we were of the opinion that the officer who made the remarks may have a case to answer for misconduct and should attend a misconduct meeting. We were also of the opinion that a second officer, who failed to challenge the officer when he made the remarks and to report his inappropriate behaviour, also had a case to answer for misconduct. As he had acknowledged his failings and reflected on his behaviour, we suggested this could be dealt with by way of management action. We also found that the performance of the supervising officer had been unsatisfactory.\\nAfter reviewing our report WMP agreed with our findings. At a misconduct meeting held by West Midlands Police in summer 2018 the case against the officer who had made the comments was found to be proven. The officer received a final written warning.

The woman was under the influence of alcohol and was therefore put on rousing checks after being placed in a cell.\\nA designated detention officer (DDO) entered the woman’s cell at approximately 6am to check on her. The woman told the DDO that another DDO had touched her breasts while carrying out rousing checks earlier. This was brought to the attention of their supervisor. A complaint was recorded and referred to us.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the DDO whose conduct was investigated. They also obtained a statement from the woman. They viewed CCTV from the custody suite and enhanced sections of it.\\nBased on this evidence the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, to find gross misconduct in respect of the DDO for breaching the standards of professional behaviour.\\nWe also submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for them to consider possible charges common assault, sexual assault, and misconduct in public office.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed in January 2018 to refer the DDO to a gross misconduct hearing to answer alleged breaches to the Police Staff Performance and Attendance Standard Operating Procedure. However, as the DDO had just resigned, no disciplinary proceedings could take place.\\nIn summer 2018, the CPS advised that they had charged the former DDO with two counts of sexual assault. In early 2019 the DDO went on trial and was acquitted of both charges.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Corruption and abuse of power', 'Custody and detention', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

When police arrived, the man had been restrained by members of the public, who had also removed the knife from him and held him for around five to ten minutes while waiting for the police to arrive.\\nTwo MPS officers took over the restraint, handcuffed the man, and moved him to a sitting position, as he appeared to have difficulty breathing. The man was able to say he had asthma, but didn’t appear to have an inhaler on him. Officers called an ambulance, as they were concerned about his breathing and his mental health. They decided to move the man to a chair to help him breathe more easily. The man tried to get up and make off while still handcuffed, but only managed to fall off the chair. Officers restrained the man on the ground as he thrashed about. \\xa0As officers walked him to the police van, the man kicked out and used his weight, refusing to support himself to hinder them. They lifted him onto the van, as he refused to step into it. They considered placing the man outside in the recovery position, but were concerned they may not be able to keep control of him in view of his erratic behaviour, and that he posed a risk to the public in the park.\\nThe ambulance arrived and paramedics tried to assess the man, while he continued to resist. He was given oxygen and treatment for drug overdose. The man was then taken to hospital, where he was treated. He died the next day from multiple organ failure and acute complications from cocaine misuse causing significant damage to his bowel.\\nWe investigated the circumstances in which the man had died, as well as complaints made by his family regarding their contact with police while he was in hospital.\\nOur investigators attended the scene and conducted a detailed examination. We identified a number of witnesses and took statements from them. We secured and analysed body-worn footage and police van footage and compared that to accounts from the officers. The pathologist instructed medical experts to analyse samples and provide reports.\\nNone of the witnesses to the restraint expressed any concern as to the way the man had been handled by officers.

In addition to this, the victim’s mobile phone was submitted for analysis and download of the text/photo messages and videos. The detective constable was informed via email that the results of the mobile phone download were available for him to view.\\nThe detective constable opened, read and deleted the email. He did not view the results of the mobile phone download. There were a number of Interpol enquiries for further information in relation to the content of the messages and conversation between the victim and the suspect. The detective constable did not respond to those requests, believing it would be disproportionate to do so. In March 2015, the investigation was closed.\\nIn March 2016, there was another incident (not involving the suspect) whereby the family contacted Northamptonshire Police. On that occasion, the victim disclosed that they were still being contacted and controlled by the suspect.\\nNorthamptonshire Police re-opened the December 2014 investigation. A new officer in charge examined the results from victim’s phone, which had been available since January 2015. There were 3,925 texts, photos and videos on the phone download, many of which were of a sexual and explicit nature and demonstrated the control the suspect exerted over the victim.\\nIn 2016, the suspect received a custodial sentence and an extended sexual harm prevention order for offences against the teenage child.\\nNorthamptonshire Police received a formal complaint from the teenager’s family in November 2016 saying that, had a thorough investigation been conducted in 2014, their child would not have been subjected to continued abuse until the suspect was arrested.\\nDuring our investigation, investigators served the detective constable, detective sergeant and the detective inspector involved in the investigation in 2014 with notices saying that there was an indication that their conduct potentially breached the standards of professional behaviour, possibly amounting to gross misconduct.\\nThe police sergeant and police inspector both provided written statements in response to their notices. The detective constable did not answer any of the questions put to him during his interview but provided two written statements.\\nThe Investigator also obtained statements from several witnesses.\\nThe Investigator concluded that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could conclude that the detective constable may have a case to answer for gross misconduct, and that the detective sergeant and the detective inspector may have a case to answer for misconduct.\\nWe sent our report to Northamptonshire Police in September 2017.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Northamptonshire Police agreed that the conduct of both the detective sergeant and detective inspector had breached the standards of professional behaviour. They proposed to deal with this through management action in this case, delivered by a senior detective who would review the incident with both officers and reassure themselves that the officers are now more intrusive and prescriptive in similar cases.\\nAs the detective constable had transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service, we also sent them a copy of our report. They agreed to hold gross misconduct proceedings for the detective constable.\\nThe gross misconduct hearing took place in late 2018.\\nThe panel found gross misconduct for the detective constable for failing to view or otherwise use in any way the evidence available from the download of the mobile telephone, and for failing to provide Interpol with information so that the line of enquiry through the authorities of the other country could be followed through.\\nThe panel also found misconduct for the detective constable for failing to secure evidence from the victim by conducting or arranging an ‘achieving best evidence’ interview, and for failing to bring concerns about his skill set, competency, welfare or training to his supervisors to seek assistance to enable him to carry out this work diligently.\\nThe detective constable had resigned from the force in February 2018.

The two officers spoke to the woman, directed her inside the police station, and told the front counter staff that she needed a taxi. The woman went into the police station, spoke briefly to a member of front counter staff and then walked away from the police station towards Middlesbrough town centre. The two officers drove past her as she walked to the taxi rank. Later that night, the woman was raped by another taxi driver, who was later convicted of the offence.\\nThe woman’s mother made a complaint in June 2016 about the way in which the two police officers had dealt with her.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators analysed CCTV from Middlesbrough police station, and obtained statements from witnesses including the taxi driver, the friends who the woman had spent the evening with, and the police station front counter staff. Investigators also obtained evidence relating to Cleveland Police Professional Standards Department’s initial review of the incident and transcripts of the evidence that the two officers had given at the rape trial. We initially determined that there was an indication that the two Cleveland Police officers may have behaved in a manner which would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings and served them with notices of investigation. Both officers gave substantial written responses and so it was not necessary to interview them.\\nThe Lead Investigator was of the opinion, based on the evidence available, that the woman was neither drunk and incapable, under the Authorised Professional Practice definition, nor liable to be arrested for being drunk and disorderly. The officers did not consider the woman to be vulnerable. Even if officers had considered the woman to be vulnerable, they still would not have had any lawful power to detain her, or any statutory duty to obtain medical attention for her.\\nTherefore, the investigation found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary or criminal proceedings.\\nHowever, our investigation highlighted some gaps in training within the force around vulnerability and risk. We found that neither officer had attended Cleveland Police’s training ‘Vulnerability and night time economy’, which was not mandatory for them. The training highlights a number of factors of what makes a person vulnerable. Two of these are ‘being under the influence of alcohol or drugs’ and ‘being alone’. The evidence indicated that the woman was vulnerable under that definition, and that neither officer recognised her as such. The training highlights a number of options for officers to consider when dealing with people who are vulnerable through drink or drugs.\\nAfter reviewing our report Cleveland Police agreed with our findings. The force also agreed to a wider delivery of the ‘Vulnerability and night time economy’ training and general vulnerability and risk training.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Cleveland Police']}\n",

They arrived at hospital at approximately 11.30am; the officer stayed with the man for 30 minutes and then left the hospital at approximately 12pm.\\nAt 12.06pm a member of the hospital staff called Cleveland Police to advise the man had left the hospital before being assessed.

They also obtained audio recordings of calls regarding the man, and documentary evidence from hospital and police systems.\\nAt the end of the investigation, based on the evidence available, we were of the view that the police officer had acted appropriately in their dealings with the man. The officer believed that they were simply being notified by the control room that the man had left hospital because of their earlier contact with them, and that any further action should have been directed by the control room. We considered this to be reasonable in the circumstances and were therefore of the opinion that the officer did not have a case to answer for misconduct or any performance issues to address.\\nWe were also of the opinion that the performance of two contractors working in the control room could be considered unsatisfactory for the following reasons: failing to conduct a risk assessment; failing to consider the man as a missing person; and failing to ensure that appropriate safeguarding enquiries were carried out after the man had left hospital without being assessed. We found no performance issues for a third contractor working in the control room.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Cleveland Police agreed that the performance of both control room contractors would be dealt with as unsatisfactory performance, to include a meeting with their line managers.

When officers arrived, the property was in darkness. They knocked and were allowed entry by a man. A struggle then took place between the officers and the man, resulting in the man being punched to the face. He was then arrested for assault police and taken to the police station.\\nWhile in custody the man asked to see a healthcare professional. After being examined, he was taken to hospital for assessment and treatment, and came back to custody a few hours later. His injuries were listed as “soft tissue damage to the wrist and shoulder…. fractured eye socket and nose.”\\nThe man later complained that the force used by the officers was excessive and unnecessary, and that he was not taken to hospital in a timely manner. The complaint was referred to us and we carried out an investigation.\\nBecause of a parallel police investigation, we were unable to start our investigation into the man’s complaint until August 2016.\\nDuring the course of the investigation our investigators took accounts from the man, his partner and the officers who went to his home. The man’s injuries were not confirmed as he didn’t attend his hospital follow-up appointments.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that three of the officers may have breached the standards of professional behaviour and may have a case to answer for gross misconduct for their use of force on the man. We were also of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find a case to answer for misconduct for any of the officers in relation to the man’s treatment in custody. We completed our investigation report and sent it to GMP in July 2017.\\nWe also sent the report and a file evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) so they could consider any criminal charges.\\nAfter reviewing our report, GMP agreed in September 2017 to hold a gross misconduct hearing for all three officers.\\nIn November 2017 the CPS returned their decision not to file any charges for the officers.\\nFollowing the CPS decision, GMP contacted us in January 2018 to revise their original determinations. After an extensive exchange of views between us, the force agreed in March 2018 that the matter would go to a gross misconduct hearing.\\xa0\\nThe hearing concluded in November 2018 and the panel found that the case had not been proven against the officers.

The man alleged that police officers and police staff used excessive force against him by. He also alleged he was not read his rights or provided with the reason for his arrest. The man made a complaint to Kent Police, which was referred to us.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed a police sergeant, obtained various witness accounts for custody staff, examined custody records, reviewed custody CCTV footage and relevant policy and guidance.\\nEvidence suggested that the man was not read his rights upon arriving to custody as he was considered ‘too drunk and violent’.\\nIn addition, the CCTV footage showed the man’s arm protruding through the cell hatch. The police sergeant took hold of the arm and attempted to push it back through the cell hatch door. Unsuccessful in doing so, the police sergeant then applied four hammer strikes with the bottom part of his fist to the man’s arm.\\nAt the end of the investigation we were of the opinion that the amount of force that the police sergeant used on the man while he was in his cell could be considered to be a breach of professional standards.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Kent Police agreed, and a gross misconduct hearing was scheduled.\\nWe also passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service and a charge of common assault was brought. The police sergeant was initially convicted of common assault, but, following an appeal, this conviction was overturned.\\nAt the misconduct hearing, the panel was satisfied that the police sergeant’s use of force was justified and necessary, and found misconduct not proven, even on the balance of probabilities.

Officers went to the woman’s house, and reported that no offences had been disclosed.\\nOn 5 June 2017, two members of the public called 999 to report a domestic disturbance, during which a man could be heard threatening to kill someone. Officers attended. The report concerned the same woman who had called two days previously. They took her to her mother’s house at her request. They later recorded that she hadn’t reported any offences.\\nDuring a subsequent review, it was discovered that the woman had made an allegation of assault during her call to police on 3 June 2017. One of the attending officers was tasked with making further enquiries. She spoke with the woman on 21 June 2017, and the woman said that she had been drinking that night and no longer believed she had been assaulted.\\nOn 25 June 2017, a member of the public called 999 to report that he had heard a man shouting “die” and a woman shouting for help. He did not know the exact address, but the information he provided indicated two possible addresses, one of which was the address of the woman subject of the reports of 3 and 5 June 2017. Two officers arrived and spoke to the woman’s partner, who denied any knowledge of a disturbance.\\nOn 1 July 2017, the woman’s partner contacted the North Wales Ambulance Service to report that she had fallen down the stairs.

The subject later transpired to be the man who had applied to join Cheshire Constabulary. On 25 January 2017, West Mercia Police received an allegation relating to the same man persistently asking a girl on social media to meet with him. Although some details were known about the suspect for both allegations, there was not enough information for officers to trace and identify him. On 19 February 2017, Staffordshire Police received an allegation of rape from an adult woman relating to the same man.\\nWhile Cheshire Constabulary was still processing the man’s application, the force became aware of the Staffordshire Police investigation into the rape allegation made by the adult woman received on 19 February 2017. Cheshire Constabulary then put the man’s application to join as a police constable on hold, pending the outcome of the Staffordshire Police investigation\\nOn 6 March 2017, Cheshire Constabulary was made aware that the man had been voluntarily interviewed and fully co-operated with the Staffordshire Police investigation, and that no further action would be taken. On the same day, the Cheshire Constabulary vetting team sent an email to an officer within Cheshire Constabulary informing them of the decision made by Staffordshire Police, and asking whether they were content to accept the outcome, or required further information. This officer replied confirming they were content.\\nThe man joined Cheshire Constabulary as a police constable on 24 April 2017.\\nThe man was arrested on 4 November 2017 and charged with the rape of a girl under 16 he met in the course of his duties. He was remanded in custody and dismissed from the force.\\nOur investigators obtained copies of email chains sent between forces, and further analysis of when details of the crimes mentioned above would have been uploaded onto the PND. They also obtained statements from witnesses. The Cheshire Constabulary officer who confirmed they were content with the update from Staffordshire Police was served with a notice of investigation. They provided two written responses, which were reviewed by our investigator.\\nOur investigation found that Cheshire Constabulary was not aware of the Staffordshire Police investigation into allegations of sexual activity with a child, which had commenced on 15 January 2017, as Staffordshire Police had not linked that case to the rape allegations made by the adult woman on 19 February 2017.\\nIn respect of the allegations investigated by West Mercia in January 2017, no criminal offences were disclosed, and West Mercia had been unable to trace the man.\\n\\xa0\\nWe also found that Cheshire Constabulary had vetted the man before the alleged offences were committed/reported, so any details added on to a police database afterwards would not have been shown on the Cheshire Constabulary vetting report.\\nAt the end of the investigation we were of the view that there was insufficient evidence detailing exactly what would be considered to be the Cheshire Constabulary officer’s duties and responsibilities, which meant there would also similarly be insufficient evidence that there had been any breach of the standards of professional behaviour around those duties and responsibilities to the level at which misconduct proceedings would be justified.\\nIn addition, we did not consider that any potential performance lapses by the officer were at the level required for consideration of unsatisfactory performance procedures being considered.\\nThe officer has accepted that, with hindsight, they could have adopted a more interventionist and inquisitive approach.

The man disclosed details of his son’s medical history, following which WMP decided that the son was a ‘missing person’ and determined that a ‘safe and well’ enquiry should be conducted at the son’s home address. The incident was graded as priority 2, requiring a response “as soon as possible and within 60 minutes of receiving the call”. The man called again at 7.34pm to say he was concerned that his son may have had a seizure and was alone in his flat.\\nOfficers went to the son’s home the following morning. They forced entry and found him dead in his flat.\\nWe examined the incident and concluded that the correct grading had been assigned to it. We also obtained resourcing information for 30 and 31 December 2017 and concluded that the force was experiencing a busy period; it would not have been possible for officers to go to the son’s flat sooner than they did, as police were responding to more urgent priority incidents.\\nWe obtained information from the pathologist, which suggested the man’s son may have died before the initial phone call to police. Therefore, response time was not a factor in his death.\\nIn our opinion there was no evidence that WMP caused or contributed to the death of the man’s son.\\nBased on the evidence available we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or had committed a criminal offence.\\nAs part of our investigation we identified areas for improvement for WMP around introducing measures to ensure that cases awaiting resourcing are referred to a supervisor at regular intervals, to review risk, actions and possible resourcing.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the force agreed that they would address the identified learning around ensuring that overdue and unresourced priority 2 logs involving missing persons are regularly reviewed by a contact centre supervisor until resourced, to ensure that risk is managed appropriately.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'West Midlands Police']}\n",

The force conducted a missing person investigation, which involved several requests made to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) after information was provided suggesting the girls may be in that force area. Both girls were ultimately located five days after the missing report at an address within GMP force area, with an older man. One of the girls subsequently disclosed sexual contact had taken place between her and the man.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained statements from officers and staff from both forces involved in the incident. They also obtained and reviewed a range of documents, as well as emails and phone calls between the forces.\\nOur investigation identified that GMP did not conduct the enquiries requested by Staffordshire Police expeditiously. The most serious of these failures concerned a neglect to act quickly once a likely address where the girls may have been both present and at risk of sexual abuse had been identified via intelligence checks. As this information was sent to a generic GMP email address we were unable to identify the individual GMP officer(s) or GMP staff member(s) who first received it and failed to act diligently and expeditiously when receiving it. Had this individual, or these individuals, been identified then they would have been served with a misconduct notice.\\nWe identified a number of learning areas for GMP around this investigation and recommended that GMP fully review the force’s actions to locate the missing vulnerable girls to further identify all learning.\\nWe were of the opinion that the actions to find the missing girls would have been managed more efficiently had GMP taken overall ownership of the missing person enquiry as soon as the intelligence checks identifying a likely location where they could be, and at risk of sexual abuse, had been identified. We recommended that GMP examine and, if necessary, update relevant force policies in this area.\\nAs the requests from Staffordshire Police were only ever treated by GMP as cross-force assistance requests, the GMP missing person policy was never implemented, meaning that the girls were never risk assessed in accordance with this policy. Specifically, we identified that GMP should have updated Staffordshire Police regularly in relation to their requests, instead of needing to be chased.\\nWe believe that GMP should have created a high-priority force-wide incident number (FWIN) to visit the suspect man’s address after receiving it from their intelligence branch, and again when an email from Staffordshire Police containing similar information was received 14 hours later.\\nOur investigation has established that the GMP IT system did not have the capability for us to ascertain by whom and when these two very significant emails were opened, so could not identify individuals who failed to create the appropriate FWIN. We believe that GMP should consider whether it is feasible to update their IT system so that such capability would be available in future.\\nAfter reviewing our report and our recommendations, the force agreed. GMP advised that it will remind appropriate staff of their responsibilities around escalation and ownership regarding missing from home enquiries. The force accepted that not following the cross-border procedure resulted in a lack of ownership. GMP also advised that a new data service to be rolled out within the next 12 months will mean that it will be possible to find out who receives and opens emails.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Child sexual abuse', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Greater Manchester Police', 'Staffordshire Police']}\n",

Investigators served notices of investigation on six officers and interviewed them under misconduct cautions.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that one police officer had a case to answer for misconduct for failing to undertake an effective search of the man’s home, incorrectly informing the man’s neighbour that the entirety of the man’s house has been searched, and incorrectly informing a police inspector that the area under the man’s bed had been searched.\\nWe also identified performance issues for three other officers for failing to ensure that the man’s house was searched in line with North Yorkshire Police policy.\\nIn addition to individual learning for officers – including around risk assessment when dealing with missing persons where diabetes is a known risk factor – we also identified what appeared to be a chain of missed opportunities involving a number of police officers and police staff in NYP. We suggested that NYP may wish to consider what learning can be taken from this incident and how this can be shared to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident occurring again.\\nAfter reviewing our report, NYP agreed that the performance of three officers would be dealt with under stage 1 of the unsatisfactory performance procedure, and that they would hold a misconduct meeting for one officer. The force acknowledged the missed opportunities and advised that they would take various actions to use learning from this case, including in their training (including for student officers), to prevent a reoccurrence in future.\\nThe force held a misconduct meeting for the officer in autumn 2018, at which the chair concluded that the officer had been diligent in exercising his duties and carrying out the search.

His detention in custody was authorised. The young man’s police national checks record included warning markers for anxiety and self-harm. The custody observation level was set to level 1 – general observations, where he would be visited every 30 minutes. The young detainee was deemed by a healthcare professional to be fit to be interviewed.\\nThe young man’s custody record showed that, while in police custody, he banged his head on the walls in the interview room and on the floor when in the corridor. It also confirmed that he tied a ligature around his neck after he went back to his cell. As a result, a strip search was carried out by police officers without the presence of an appropriate adult. His clothes were removed and he was provided with anti-harm clothing. The young detainee was subsequently placed on level 4 observation – close proximity with rousal checks. The young man remained in his cell with his appropriate adult from 7.16pm until he was released at approximately 9.58pm.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed custody officers and staff. We interviewed five officers under the misconduct caution in respect of a number of allegations in relation to safeguarding the welfare of the young man and conducting the strip search. The young man and his appropriate adult were also asked to provide statements, but declined to engage with us. All relevant custody CCTV footage was also collected as evidence. We also reviewed relevant legislation and policies.\\nAt the end of the investigation, based on the evidence available, we found that one officer had a case to answer for misconduct and should receive management action for not being diligent in the execution of his duties, in that there may not have been adequate consideration to reviewing the young man’s observation levels, or searching him or his cell, or a lack of appropriate record keeping about this. We recommended management action for the same officer for not recording his rationale to order that a strip search be carried out without the presence of an appropriate adult. It was agreed with Essex Police that the officer would be subject to an operational debrief regarding the findings of our investigation, outcome and standards expected, which would include reinforcing his knowledge and understanding of risk assessment and expectation, and procedures with particular attention to searches.\\nWe found that there was no case to answer for a second and third officer in relation to conducting the strip search.\\nWe identified some learning for the fourth officer. Essex Police recommended that the officer be reminded of force procedure on digital CCTV systems in custody, with particular attention to searches.\\nWe found that there was a case to answer for misconduct for a member of police staff for conducting inadequate cells observations and failing to record changes in the young man’s behaviour in the custody log.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the force agreed with our views and held a misconduct meeting for the member of police staff.

The custody sergeant placed a call to her partner, who said he would bring it in later that morning. The medication was given to custody staff at around 9am that day.

The last attempt resulted in him being found unresponsive by custody staff, who then managed to rouse him.\\nDuring our investigation we considered the custody CCTV, custody record log, and written responses from two members of custody staff and a witness.\\nThe evidence confirmed that the man’s observation level was reduced from level three to level one by the police sergeant at approximately 10.24pm as a result of the man having calmed down and fallen asleep. In view of the man’s well documented history of self-harm in custody and attempts to self-harm when arrested, we were of the opinion that level one observation was not appropriate, and not in keeping with the force’s procedure. Following the man attempting to self-harm on multiple occasions, there was no custody officer review of the risk to the man and no increase to his level of observation.\\nEvidence also indicated that the police sergeant failed to keep the custody record appropriately updated and may not have fully assessed and reviewed the ongoing risk to the man, which is against policy/guidance. However, as the man was in a CCTV cell and checked every 30 minutes overnight, we were of the opinion that this wasn’t so serious as to amount to misconduct, and that the officer’s performance issues could be dealt with by means of management action. The same officer also left some items of clothing in the man’s cell that could be used as ligature. There is no set policy regarding retention of clothing by detainees, and we were of the view that this could also be dealt with by way of management action.\\nEvidence also indicated that a detention officer did not inform the custody sergeant that the man had attempted to self-harm. This had already been dealt with by the force through management action soon after the incident.\\nAfter reviewing our report the force agreed that the performance of both officers had been unsatisfactory and that they would receive (or had received) management action.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Hampshire Constabulary']}\n",

On the same day, officers decided to detain the man under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA). He was then taken to a mental health unit and placed in a room while awaiting assessment. It was reported that the man was trying to kick his way out of the room he had been placed in, and a request was made for more officers to attend.\\nInformation suggested that the man appeared to be having a mental health episode and to be very violent. It was decided that hospital staff would sedate the man, but officers would need to assist due to his level of violence.\\nThere were two teams of three public order trained officers present at the scene and two Taser-trained staff. Officers conducted a risk assessment and requested more patrols. This request was refused.

The man was placed in handcuffs, but he resisted and the officers placed leg restraints on him. The man was then carried to a police vehicle and taken to Chelmsford police station. On arrival the man continued to resist aggressively. He was carried directly into a cell, where his level of observation was set to 4 – close proximity. The man was strip searched without an appropriate adult present, as his age and identity had not been established at the time. He was placed into anti-harm clothing. He became aggressive again and was restrained by five officers, handcuffed in a rear stack position.\\nThe man continued to behave aggressively and to struggle with the officers despite attempts by the officers to calm him down. The officers were instructed by another officer to leave the man alone in his cell, handcuffed to the rear, face down on a mattress on the floor. The door was closed and officers observed the man through the spyhole for fifty-five seconds and then through the cell hatch. His breathing became deep and heavy. Shortly after, the man’s legs stopped moving and his breathing could no longer be heard. Officers entered the cell, removed the handcuffs and put the man in the recovery position. They called for an ambulance. Paramedics then attended to the man. They considered that he didn’t need to go to hospital.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the officer who was responsible for the man’s welfare when the incident happened, examined the custody CCTV footage and obtained statements from several police witnesses. The man did not engage with the investigation and did not provide a statement.\\nWe were of the opinion that, although the officer in charge of the man did not follow the correct procedure by leaving him in the cell in a prone position while handcuffed to the rear and then viewing him through the spyhole then hatch, this did not suggest that the officer had any disregard for the man’s welfare. The officer actively monitored the man and took immediate action when the man appeared to have difficulty breathing. We therefore suggested that management action would be the most proportionate way of dealing with the officer’s misconduct.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Essex Police determined that the officer did not have a case to answer for misconduct. The force proposed to draw wider learning opportunities from this investigation by using it as a case study to support training provided to Essex Police custody staff.

After requesting intelligence checks on the address, they considered they didn’t have enough information to force entry. They cancelled the ambulance. The police unit left and the MPS continued attempts to contact the original caller. After no response, the incident log was closed.\\nOn 14 April 2017 at 9.09pm, the MPS was contacted by the daughter of the person who made the initial call.\\xa0 The daughter was concerned as she had not heard from her mother since 11 April 2017. A police unit attended and was able to gain entry to the woman’s flat through the back door, which was closed but unlocked. They found the woman dead in her flat. A post-mortem later recorded the cause of death as heart disease.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed the call handlers, despatchers and obtained statements from attending police officers.\\nThe Investigator formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find gross misconduct for one call staff member for incorrectly grading the first call and recording incorrect and insufficient information; and misconduct for another call staff member for carrying out incomplete checks on the caller’s address when officers attended on 12 April.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed with our findings. The call staff member who took the original call resigned before the gross misconduct hearing, so no further action could be taken against them. A misconduct meeting was held for the second call staff. They were given informal management action, with an emphasis on further coaching and relevant training.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

Concerns were raised about the man’s mental health because he had disclosed how he had recently attempted suicide and had thoughts about committing suicide every other day. The man also described how he would take his own life. While in custody, the man was seen by a healthcare professional, who said that the man had no mental health diagnosis and that he was fit to be detained and interviewed.\\nThe man was released without charge the following day and he went home.

Three officers were subsequently served with misconduct notices.\\nBased on the evidence available, at the end of the investigation, we were of the opinion that three officers had a case to answer for misconduct: one officer for failing to consider the risk to the man on his release based on the information provided by his family and for not recording that the man had regular thoughts of suicide; a second officer for failing to follow policy in not documenting handover from and to other officers; and a third officer for not gathering all the information available in the custody record when considering the risks to the man on his release from custody.\\nWe were of the opinion that the potential misconduct matters identified were at the lower end of the misconduct spectrum and would be best addressed by way of management action.\\nWe also recommended that the force may want to consider defining specific times for the assessment of detainees by healthcare professionals and put steps in place for escalation should that time be exceeded.\\nAfter reviewing our report Nottinghamshire Police’s view was that the first officer had considered all of the information and made sound decisions with that information.

The officer illuminated his vehicle’s blue lights to indicate to the driver to stop. However, the driver failed to do so and the force control room authorised a pursuit.

The officer was driving to a police station to assist colleagues with booking a man into custody. The man had just been arrested and was being transported in a separate van. The man was reported to be behaving aggressively and the officer stated he was trying to catch up with the van in order to assist colleagues in dealing with the man on arrival at the station.\\nAt the same time, a member of the public was approaching the same junction, with his wife as a passenger in the car. As he approached the triangular ‘Y’ junction he intended to turn right and right again at the junction, back onto the same road but in the opposite direction.\\nThe member of the public turned right at the junction and the police car collided with him. The front of the police car hit the rear of the other car. Because of the collision, the man was admitted to hospital in Sheffield with spinal fractures.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the police driver under criminal and misconduct cautions. We also examined data evidence relating to the speed of the police car.\\nEvidence showed that the officer had been driving at a peak speed of 66mph in a 40mph zone approximately 1.15 seconds before the collision. In interview, the officer said they had been making use of their legal exemption from the prescribed speed limit for policing purposes. The data recorder within the car showed that the police driver did not activate the emergency equipment (siren, blue or rear flashing red lights) while using their legal exemption and prior to the collision.\\nWe were not able to determine the point of collision, and therefore to establish the point on the road at which the officer applied the brakes, to determine the police car’s line of sight or position in relation to the junction.\\nThe Investigator was of the opinion that the officer should have reduced their speed on approaching the potential hazard posed by the emerging junction and made use of the car’s emergency warning equipment.

The officers removed the man from the car and restrained him on the ground while waiting for a police van to continue the journey to the custody suite. He received a number of injuries while he was restrained on the ground. On arrival at the police station the man was assessed by a healthcare professional, who advised he didn’t need any medical attention. The following morning, he was seen by a nurse, who advised the man should be assessed in hospital. The accident and emergency discharge record shows the man had bruising to the right side of his face and right side of his chest\\nThe man subsequently complained to the force that he had been assaulted by two police officers on his way to custody. The force investigated this complaint locally and found no case to answer. The man appealed against the outcome of the investigation. After reviewing the force’s initial investigation and following an appeal by the complainant, we decided to investigate the matter ourselves in January 2017.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators interviewed the two officers, reviewed all material gathered by Sussex Police Professional Standards Department and liaised with the complainant via his solicitor.\\nThe Investigator concluded there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find that the officers had a case to answer for gross misconduct for use of excessive force and for not following policy and training.

The man was reported to have flown to Heathrow for a planned trip to the UK, but had not returned as expected. His family found a note indicating the man intended to end his life at Beachy Head in Sussex, and raised concerns about his welfare.\\nA police officer started to conduct research to find out if the man had left the UK. By 4pm the man’s photograph had been circulated at Beachy Head. Checks with the airline had confirmed the man did not board his flight back home three days earlier. At 10.52pm the man’s photograph was passed to the missing person team.\\nFollowing a divisional meeting the following morning, the man was considered to be a high-risk missing person and efforts to locate him were led by the missing person team.\\nA short time later, a pile of belongings believed to belong to the missing man were found in the Beachy Head area.

Following the booking in process, which included input from a healthcare professional (HCP), the man was placed on the highest observation level – close proximity constant observations – due to his demeanour and admission to having recently consumed controlled drugs.\\nAt approximately 7am on 15 July it was recorded that, after speaking to the HCP, the man’s observation level was reduced to Level 1 with 30-minute checks.\\nAt 9.36pm on 16 July the man pressed the cell buzzer and spoke to staff on the custody desk. He informed them he had just tried to kill himself. A custody sergeant arrived in his cell and found him with a ligature around his neck. The man was immediately put back on the highest level of observations, and it was recorded that the man had made the ligature by ripping his t-shirt. The man remained in this t-shirt.\\nAt 11.45pm an entry in the custody record stated a verbal handover had been given to all custody staff for the following shift and that the man had now been put on the next level down of observations, which was constant observations via CCTV.\\nAt 1.10am on 17 July the man was found unconscious during routine cell checks with a ligature wrapped around his neck. The ligature again was made from ripped parts of his t-shirt. The custody sergeant retrospectively entered in the custody record the man’s observation level had been changed to the lowest level and had been found with the ligature before the custody record and care plan had been updated.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators obtained CCTV footage and statements from several officers and staff who worked in custody on the two days.

However, evidence appeared to indicate that the second custody sergeant had not reviewed important and valuable information, which may have changed their assessment of the man’s risk level and therefore his observation level. We were of the opinion that this would be best addressed through management advice.\\nAfter reviewing our report Hampshire Constabulary agreed that the second custody sergeant would receive management action focused on the decision-making and risk assessment process surrounding custody observation levels.\\nOur investigation also highlighted areas for improvement for the force in their local policy in relation to removing clothing and providing anti-rip replacement clothing for detainees who express suicidal thoughts.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Hampshire Constabulary']}\n",

There was a history of reports of anti-social problems in this area and there existed a policing response plan to calls to this vicinity. Two officers arrived and approached a group standing outside opposite the man’s house, which included the people alleged to have been in possession of the weapons. The group said they had not seen or heard anything to support the man’s allegation.\\nOfficers spoke to the man who made the original call. He said the suspects had put their weapons in their car. Officers searched the car but found nothing. One of the officers arrested the man for wasting police time and for a section 5 public order offence. This was in respect of an allegation made two days earlier by one of the men named by the caller that the man had sworn at him.\\nThe officers conducted a search of the man’s address and seized some of his property. The arresting officer put the man in handcuffs and escorted him to the marked police vehicle outside his home. A member of the group outside videoed this and subsequently uploaded it on to social media. The man alleged that the group made racist noises and that the officers did nothing about it. The officers took the man to custody, where he informed the custody sergeant that he was observing Ramadan. He was in custody for several hours.\\nThe man made a complaint to Norfolk Constabulary a few days after the incident. Due to the serious nature of the complaint it was referred to us for review. We then decided that Norfolk Constabulary should investigate, and suggested a number of considerations to be taken into account.\\nIn his complaint, the man alleged that the officers:\\nHe also made allegations specifically regarding one officer, saying that he had arrested and handcuffed him with no justification, mishandled his property, had been discourteous and had acted in a discriminatory manner.\\nThe man also made a complaint about the fact he had been detained in custody for several hours when the police were aware that he was fasting for Ramadan and that he was unable to break his fast with his family.\\nIn June 2016, Norfolk Constabulary completed its investigation and reached the conclusion that only one aspect of the complaint was upheld. This was regarding the search of the complainant’s house. It considered this error to be one of performance and not conduct. This resulted in management action, an informal outcome which focuses on officers improving an officer’s performance to prevent similar situations arising in the future.\\nIn July 2016 we were notified that the complainant had appealed against the findings. We reviewed the appeal and original investigation material and, in October 2016, upheld the appeal. We also decided to independently re-investigate the investigation completed by Norfolk Constabulary.\\nDuring the investigation a volume of material was gathered and analysed. The Investigator formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a panel could find misconduct for two officers in relation to the following:\\nThe Investigator also formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a panel could find misconduct for one of the officers in relation to the following:\\nIn May 2017 we were informed that one of the officers had resigned in April 2017 and therefore, as a former officer (and as the law stood at the relevant time), no disciplinary proceedings could be brought.\\nAfter reviewing our report Norfolk Constabulary disagreed with our recommendation to hold a misconduct meeting for the officer still serving. It suggested management action instead. We considered Norfolk Constabulary’s rationale and directed the force to hold a misconduct meeting.\\nA misconduct meeting was held in the summer of 2018 for the remaining officer, which concluded the case was proven in relation to the intrusive property search, and that the officer had breached the standards of professional behaviour in relation to authority, duties and responsibility. As the officer had previously received management action following the outcome of the original investigation completed by Norfolk Constabulary and there had been no further re-occurrences, the Chair of the panel concluded that the officer should be given further management advice specifically to familiarise himself with powers of police in relation to searches.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Norfolk Constabulary']}\n",

A student complained that the use of the CS spray was an unnecessary use of force directed at him and that he had received an eye injury due to the incident. The incident was captured on CCTV and mobile footage.\\nOther protestors also made complaints relating to WMP, among other things, the use of force during that incident. WMP referred the complaints to us on 5 January 2015 and it was determined that we would investigate them.\\nDuring the investigation we found indications that the use of force by two officers, including the officer who used CS spray on the student, may be considered a breach of professional standards.\\nThe final report reflected the conclusion that there was no case to answer in misconduct or gross misconduct. We sent our investigation report to WMP in September 2015 and the force in turn determined that there was no case to answer.\\nThe student subsequently challenged the outcome of our investigation by judicial review. A judge held that the investigation was adequate, but quashed our decision that there was no case to answer in misconduct in relation to the officer’s use of force against the student. The matter relating to the student was then reinvestigated to reach a fresh decision\\nIn light of the finding of the judicial review that the previous investigation in to the student’s complaints was adequate, we adopted and considered all the evidence gathered in the previous investigation for the second investigation.\\nWe considered the statement made by the officer during his previous interview as well as statements from several witnesses, including the person who sustained an injury during the use of force, and re-examined CCTV of the incident.\\nBased on the evidence available, the Investigator was of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal could conclude that the officer used CS spray at a distance of less than one metre in circumstances in which he could have avoided this, and that the officer therefore had a case to answer in misconduct. In the Investigator’s opinion, if a tribunal found that the force used by the officer was unreasonable, dismissal would not be justified. The Investigator was also of the view that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the officer’s decision to use CS, spray rather than another type of force, was unreasonable.\\nAfter reviewing our report, WMP disagreed that the officer may have a case to answer for misconduct. Their view was that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, would be unlikely to make a finding, on the balance of probabilities, of misconduct in relation to the distance that the officer used his CS spray in a volatile situation, when the decision to use the force had been examined and considered to have been justified.\\nAfter careful consideration of their rationale we recommended that the officer should attend a misconduct meeting. The force still disagreed with the recommendation and was directed to hold a misconduct meeting. The officer attended a misconduct meeting at which misconduct was not proven.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Use of force and armed policing', 'West Midlands Police']}\n",

When they left, they saw a man on the ground nearby with a woman, who said he had told her that he had banged his head. The woman left without the PCSOs recording her details.\\nThe man’s partner then approached and admitted to hitting him, and made further threats of violence towards him. The PCSOs separated the man and his partner and took no further action.\\nThat evening, West Yorkshire Police (WYP) received a telephone call on 999 reporting that a man and a woman were fighting. Police officers attended and found the man on the bridge on Great George Street – this was the same man that the PCSOs had had contact earlier; he was taken to hospital and later died.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators reviewed CCTV footage obtained by WYP as part of their investigation into the man’s death, obtained witness statements, and reviewed WYP policies and Airwave communication transmissions from the time of the incident. We found indications that the two PCSOs may have behaved in a manner which would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings. Both officers co-operated with the interview process and provided accounts of their actions.\\nBased on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the two PCSOs had a case to answer for misconduct for: failing to take appropriate positive action in response to an assault; failing to follow force’s policy regarding domestic abuse incidents; failing to obtain details of a potential significant witness; and failing to treat the man with respect or courtesy, or to identify him as vulnerable. We suggested that management action may be the most appropriate way of dealing with these issues, to reduce the risk of similar occurrences in the future and provide an opportunity for reflection and individual learning for both officers.\\nAfter reviewing our report, WYP agreed with our findings and proposed actions.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'West Yorkshire Police']}\n",

The woman was taken to hospital on a voluntary basis so her mental health could be assessed. Later that afternoon, the woman left before the assessment was conducted. Officers found her and detained her under s136 of the Mental Health Act. They returned her to the hospital for assessment.\\nLater that night, the woman’s mental health assessment was completed and it was determined that she would receive care from the Home Treatment team. The detention under s136 was lifted, but the woman requested some respite care. She was allowed the stay in the hospital overnight, on a voluntary basis.\\nOn 15 January, the woman left the hospital. Hospital staff called the police to report the woman had left and that they still had concerns for her welfare. Two officers went to the hospital, searched the local area and obtained information regarding the woman’s circumstances. Following this, a police sergeant determined that, on the basis of the information that was known at the time, and in line with force policy, the woman should be classified as ‘absent’ not ‘missing’. Police provided guidance to the hospital that the Home Treatment Team should follow up with her. A second police sergeant reviewed the incident log on the subsequent shift. This sergeant agreed the woman was not classified as ‘missing’, and the log was closed.\\nOn 17 January, WMP received a report that a woman had been found dead in a park.

They considered that the officer’s decision to use force during the arrest was appropriate, justified and proportionate, as the man was resisting arrest and behaving in an aggressive manner. Their view was that there was insufficient evidence to support the man’s allegations that the officer had kicked him. They therefore considered there was insufficient evidence for the officer to have a case to answer for misconduct, gross misconduct, or unsatisfactory performance.\\nWe considered their response and rationale and agreed that, while there was conflicting evidence in this case, the evidence appeared to weigh so heavily in favour of the officer’s account that no reasonable tribunal could accept the man’s account over it.\\nNo action was taken against either officer involved in the arrest of the man.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Use of force and armed policing', 'West Yorkshire Police']}\n",

Officers called for an ambulance, but it did not arrive and the woman was taken to hospital by the police.\\nThe next day the woman made a complaint to us alleging that she was hit on the arm prior to it breaking. The investigation also raised concerns about the language used by one of the officers prior to the woman’s arrest.\\nDuring the investigation our investigators interviewed the two officers involved.

We also examined relevant documents and procedures, including medical evidence.\\nThe investigation found that, based on the available evidence, the decision to arrest the woman was in line with policy. The evidence suggested that, due the level of injury sustained by the woman, the officers’ use of force may have been excessive and that their actions during the restraint contributed to the injury.\\nThe evidence also indicated that one of the officers’ use of language when dealing with the woman may have exacerbated her response both to him and the other people present.\\nThe investigation found that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could conclude that two officers had a case to answer for misconduct in respect of the level of force they used when restraining the woman. We also recommended that one of the officers may benefit from further training in relation to conflict resolution, and specifically communication skills.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Thames Valley Police determined that neither officer had a case to answer, but advised management action. We agreed with their determination for the officer who assisted in the arrest but did not restrain the arm which was broken. However, we recommended misconduct proceedings for the officer who broke the woman’s arm. This was accepted by Thames Valley Police.\\nA misconduct meeting found that the officer had failed to use appropriate verbal commands and used tactics inappropriate in a confined space. It was also found that the officer’s use of language was inappropriate.

He was discharged by the hospital and taken to custody later that day.\\nOur Lead Investigator attempted to engage with the man, but was unsuccessful. The Lead Investigator interviewed the officers who attended the incident and also reviewed custody CCTV, as well as the officers’ body-worn camera footage.\\nWe were not able to establish whether the man did find a bag of white powder in the back of the police van or whether he had concealed it on his person, nor that he did consume anything while in the back of the van. We were not able to determine either whether the man’s collapse had been caused by his using drugs or other substances prior to the police arriving, or by an underlying medical condition, or by him ingesting the substance he allegedly found and consumed while in the back of the police van. As the man did not engage with our investigation, we were unable to review his medical records.\\nBased on the evidence available, we found no indication that any police officer may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings or committed a criminal offence.\\nAfter reviewing our report, GMP agreed.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Greater Manchester Police']}\n",

This was following an earlier argument on 17 September 2017 with his partner who he lived with. His partner saw him grab her morphine tablets, but he told her he had disposed of them.\\nWarwickshire Police assessed the man as a high-risk missing person. The incident was referred to WMP at 12.49am, who commenced an incident log. At 1am the incident was referred back to Warwickshire and then back to WMP at 1.53am. The incident was referred back to WMP via e-mail, which according to the WMP incident log was not actioned until 6.05 am.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt 7.31am, a WMP officer was dispatched to visit the man’s partner and his parents. As part of the ongoing investigation, at 1.48 pm, a missing person log was commenced. The man was graded as medium risk. At 4.16pm, his girlfriend notified WMP that she had found him, unconscious, in his car. The man was declared dead at 5.30pm in hospital.\\nThe man’s parents raised complaints about some of the contact they had with police officers during the course of their enquiries into their son being missing.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators examined the man’s mobile phone records and obtained statements from several witnesses as well as telephone recordings and airwaves transmissions. They also obtained a statement from a WMP officer under the misconduct caution for a number of allegations involving the risk assessment and grading for the missing person investigation.\\nWe considered that, at the time of the incident, the WMP officer was inexperienced. This was the first time the officer was tasked to take a missing person report through the control room. While there were gaps in recording and actions taken, there was no evidence to indicate any of this was done in bad faith. Based on the evidence available, we were of the opinion that the officer’s poor performance should be addressed through the first stage of the unsatisfactory performance procedure.\\nWe also identified performance issues for a second WMP officer in respect of their contact with the man’s parents; and for a third WMP officer, in respect of their contact with the man’s parents and how they conducted a search of the missing man’s car.\\nAfter reading our report, WMP proposed the following: for the first officer, this would be addressed through a learning debrief, which would also include opportunities to understand the broader issues to consider in relation to missing persons’ investigations; for the second officer, the force proposed management action around their manner of speaking with the man’s family; and for the third officer, both issues should be addressed as individual reflection and learning.\\nWe agreed that their proposals were appropriate in the circumstances.\\nOur investigation highlighted some areas for improvement for both WMP and Warwickshire Police around updating live incident logs; for Warwickshire Police, around ensuring that, when a high-risk incident is transferred to another force, this is confirmed verbally by the control room Inspector; and for WMP, around handling emails in the force control room.\\nBoth forces agreed to share this learning with relevant staff for dissemination.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Warwickshire Police', 'West Midlands Police']}\n",

On the way to custody, the man continued to bang his head against the cage. A risk assessment was undertaken but not completed as the man did not co-operate. His previous custody records showed warning markers for violence and self-harm. The man was then booked into custody. He was taken to a cell and strip searched, with officers looking for a possible knife. The man’s clothing was taken and he was left in his underwear. He was placed on 30-minute observation. CCTV shows that the man started to bang his head against the cell wall. He then removed his boxer shorts and tied them around his neck. Officers went into the cell and one of them removed the boxer shorts. The man was left naked in his cell and was not provided with alternative clothing.\\nA forensic medical examiner (FME) was called to assess the man due the cuts on his forehead and injury to his right wrist from the handcuffs. The FME recorded that the man was unconscious, and an ambulance was called.\\nOn arrival at hospital, the man was given a CT scan, which did not show any brain injury. However, he was placed in an induced coma for six days, due to concerns over his fluctuating consciousness. He then remained in the intensive care unit under police guard. A mental health assessment determined the man did not require psychiatric admission and could be returned to custody and kept under observation by the FME.\\nOn 25 September, the man was discharged from hospital and taken into custody. He was placed on the highest level of observations. The FME assessed the man and recommended he be taken to hospital, as he appeared to present delusional symptoms. In hospital, the man was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid psychosis and detained for 28 days.\\nThis incident was referred to us by the force as a death or serious injury matter. A relative of the man then made a complaint to us on the man’s behalf about his arrest and detention.\\nDuring the course of our investigation, we examined CCTV footage of the custody suite, as well as the man’s custody record, medical records and contemporaneous notes made by the officers.

The officers re-attended following a report that the young people had returned to the home and a further report that they had left again.

He received minor puncture wounds to his forearms, to his left leg and to his right elbow and was taken to hospital, where he received antibiotics.\\nWe investigated the boy’s complaint that a police dog had bitten him.\\nThe police dog handler stated that a muzzle he had fitted to the dog prior to deployment had come unclipped shortly after he had re-buckled it while the dog was tracking the missing teenagers. In a statement completed one day after the incident and prior to the beginning of this investigation, the dog handler accepted that he should have checked that the muzzle remained fitted and that he had learned from the incident.\\nOur investigators reviewed the police incident logs, radio communications, documentation from the children's home, the written account of the police dog handler and relevant national police guidance. They also interviewed the boy who was bitten by the police dog and the girl with whom he went missing, who witnessed what happened.\\nThe investigation concluded that the decision to deploy the police dog was appropriate. The investigation report noted that the dog handler had a clear opportunity to observe that the muzzle had come unclipped when lifting the dog over a barbed wire fence. The investigation concluded that the dog handler paid insufficient attention to whether the dog's muzzle had remained fitted after re-buckling it, but that the lack of a muzzle did not require the search to be abandoned as there is no procedural requirement for officers to use muzzles.\\nBased on the evidence available, we did not uphold the complaint.\\n\", 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Devon and Cornwall Constabulary']}\n",

While in the holding cell, with an officer present, the woman fell to the floor, landing on her right hip, and screamed. Officers attempted to sit the woman up but she seemed unable to and asked to see a doctor. The custody nurse examined the woman but did not think that the woman had broken any bones. Three officers lifted the woman and carried her to the charge desk, holding her by her arms.\\nThe custody officer telephoned for an ambulance. Having been told there was a four-hour wait, officers discussed taking the woman to hospital in a police van, which the woman agreed to. After having a conversation with the custody nurse, who said they did not believe the woman had broken her hip, officers decided to take the woman to a CCTV cell to be observed.\\nAt approximately 11.40pm, officers explained to the woman that there had been a change of plan and that she was to be placed in a cell and seen by the nurse. An officer brought an office chair and lowered the woman on to it while the woman screamed out in pain. The woman was wheeled to the cell backwards while sitting on the chair, which the woman claimed caused her ‘unbearable pain’. In the cell, three officers lifted the woman on to the cell bench, while the woman cried out. A note was made on the custody record that the ambulance had been cancelled.\\nFrom midnight, officers made a number of checks on the woman, mostly through the spy hole or door hatch. Notes that the woman was complaining of pain were made on the custody record on several occasions.\\nAt 3.05am, the custody nurse examined the woman again, following which an officer made a telephone call asking for the woman to be taken to hospital, although it was not clear to whom they made the call. At 7.26am, following a shift handover, an officer telephoned the Yorkshire Ambulance Service to request an ambulance and at 8.16am, the woman was taken to hospital in an ambulance. She was diagnosed with a fractured hip.\\nDuring the investigation, we identified an indication that seven of the officers involved in the woman’s detention may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings and we interviewed them under the misconduct caution. They refused to answer questions put to them. We also found an indication that the custody nurse may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings and also interviewed them. The custody nurse co-operated with our investigation and answered all questions asked.\\nAs part of the investigation we also obtained and reviewed CCTV footage from the custody suite, and the woman’s custody record. We also obtained a witness statement from the woman.\\nBased on the CCTV footage we were of the opinion that the woman sustained the injury when she fell on the floor in the custody suite. There was no evidence to suggest that the officer present then was responsible for this in any way.\\nBased on the evidence available the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct in respect of six of the officers. The Lead Investigator was also of the opinion that the performance of the custody nurse, who co-operated fully with the investigation, did not amount to misconduct but could be considered unsatisfactory. West Yorkshire Police informed the local healthcare trust so they could deal with this matter.\\nAfter reviewing our report and taking into account further considerations, West Yorkshire Police held misconduct meetings for all six officers.\\nAt the meetings, misconduct was not proven for four officers and no further action taken. Misconduct was proven for one officer, who received management action. Another officer was found to have a case to answer for misconduct and received a written warning as well as management action.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Death and serious injury', 'West Yorkshire Police']}\n",

He provided the name of the man who had assaulted him and details of where he lived, which was in a flat in the immediate vicinity of the car park. Police reported to the control room that the man had a “nasty cut to the head” and an ankle injury.\\nAn officer in the control room called the Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) to establish the estimated time of arrival of an ambulance. The officer in the control room did not inform YAS of the head injury the officers had reported. Officers at the car park decided not to move the man due to his ankle injury and instead to wait for the ambulance; they placed coats and jackets over the man to keep him warm.

The officers did this, but no units were free to assist.\\nThe ambulance arrived at 2.40am and paramedics examined the man. They did not see any injury that caused them concern. However, the man’s health deteriorated while in their care, which led them to believe he may have a head injury. They transported the man to Leeds General Infirmary, where he died from a head injury six days later.\\nPolice subsequently arrested the suspect, who was later found guilty of the manslaughter of the man he assaulted.\\nAt the start of the investigation we found indications that three officers may have behaved in a manner which would justify bringing disciplinary proceedings.

The man appeared to be experiencing mental health issues and was last seen heading towards a local lake telling his employers he was going for his ‘’last walk’’. This area is a vast expanse of forest, moorland and rough terrain and the weather conditions were cold, wet and foggy.\\nAt this point, North Yorkshire Police assessed the incident as a high-risk missing from home, and officers were dispatched to attend.\\nAt 9.20pm an officer updated the Force Control Room that the man had been located by a member of the public and had returned home. The officer requested that the man be assessed by paramedics, and to this end the local mental health team (MHT) spoke with the man over the phone. The man informed the MHT that he had no intention of harming himself, but believed someone was trying to kill him.\\xa0 As a result of the call, the local MHT decided they should speak to the man face to face.\\nA NYP officer and one of the man’s colleagues took over the care of the man in his home while waiting for the MHT to arrive. During this time, the police officer temporarily left the man in the care of one of the man’s colleagues, and the man ran off into the nearby forest.\\nA search of the area around the estate was initiated. The missing person report produced at this point, which was completed by two officers, described the man as not having mental health issues and not being vulnerable, and the assessment was medium risk. The risk assessment made by supervisors co-ordinating the subsequent search for the man was recorded as low, then medium risk and eventually high risk later the next day.\\nThe search for the man, over the course of the next four days, involved the deployment of resources such as Search and Rescue, Mountain Rescue, National Police Air Service, the Royal Air Force and NYP search teams. The man was found dead in a river about 1.7 km away from his home, on 4 February 2017. A post-mortem established the cause of death was drowning.\\nDuring our investigation, investigators interviewed the officer initially attending, and obtained reports from four other officers involved in the incident, from attending the scene where the missing person was last seen, to the eventual recovery of the man’s body. We also contacted non-police witnesses. We examined the NYP decisions and responses alongside their own, and national, guidance.\\nAlthough there were initial concerns that the risk assessments levels had not been set high enough, or not in line with guidelines, the evidence showed that the resources used and the search co-ordination were comprehensive and efficient given the weather conditions, terrain and resources available.\\nBased on the evidence available, at the end of the investigation, we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings.\\nAfter reviewing our report, NYP agreed with our findings. They advised that they would act on the lessons learnt from this investigation by providing officers and staff with advice specifically in relation to the aftercare of vulnerable missing persons being returned, and would incorporate this into their policies.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'North Yorkshire Police']}\n",

The man did not co-operate and an altercation took place. Police officers used force against the man during this incident. One officer deployed pepper spray, another officer Tasered the man, and another officer punched him several times to the head. The officers handcuffed the man and placed him in a police van and took him in to custody.\\nThe next day, the man complained to Durham Constabulary that the force used during his arrest was excessive and that he had suffered injuries to his face as a result.\\nDurham Constabulary obtained CCTV footage from the public house which appeared to show one officer striking the man to the face five times immediately before handcuffing him and then strike him again a moment later. After viewing the CCTV footage, Durham Constabulary referred the complaint to us.\\nThe IOPC reviewed the CCTV footage, which appeared to show that the man resisted officers when they came to arrest him. The Lead Investigator’s view was that this would justify officers using reasonable and proportionate force in order to effect his arrest.\\nDuring the investigation we interviewed the officer who struck the man under the criminal and misconduct caution for allegations which included that he may have used excessive force and that he may have recorded details in his statement which may not be accurate in order to retrospectively justify his use of force. We also interviewed another officer under the misconduct caution as the CCTV footage appeared to show that he witnessed this use of force but did not intervene or subsequently report it.\\nBased on the evidence available the Lead Investigator was of the view that a reasonable tribunal may find that one of the officers had a case to answer for gross misconduct for:\\nThe Lead Investigator was of the view that a reasonable tribunal may find that the second officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct for:\\nWe also found indications that the officer’s use of force against the man may be considered as assault and we referred a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS authorised a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against the officer. The officer was later acquitted at court.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the force agreed to hold a gross misconduct hearing for both officers.\\nAt the hearing in summer 2018, an independent panel found that gross misconduct was not proven for the second officer. No further action will be taken against that officer. The panel also concluded that the first five punches used by the first officer were reasonable in the circumstances, but that the sixth punch amounted to gross misconduct. The officer was dismissed without notice. The officer appealed the decision, and, in spring 2019, an appeals tribunal found the grounds for appeal made out, and the allegation not proven.

An inquest held in October 2017 found that the man had died of acute alcohol intoxication. Publication of the outcome of our investigation was delayed until completion of the inquest.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators obtained a recording of the 999 call, CCTV footage from the hostel, Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) records relating to the call and Hampshire Constabulary’s training materials and policies relating to call handling and dispatch. The call handler and the dispatch operator who dealt with the incident, both members of police staff based at Hampshire Constabulary’s Force Control Room, were served with misconduct notices and interviewed under misconduct caution. Witness statements were taken from other police staff.\\nThe investigation found that the caller’s focus during the 999 call appeared to be getting the drunk, unconscious man moved on, rather than concern for the man’s welfare. However, the investigation also found that the caller had said the man was unconscious and that the call handler had not recorded this on the CAD record or asked any clarifying questions about the caller’s use of the word ‘unconscious’. The dispatch operator made the decision not to dispatch police units on the basis of the incomplete information provided by the call handler.\\nThe Lead Investigator’s opinion was that the call handler had a case to answer for misconduct, while the dispatch operator had no case to answer.\\nHampshire Constabulary agreed with this assessment and proposed that the call handler be dealt with through management action.

As a result, Lancashire Constabulary (which remained the lead force for the investigation) requested assistance from Merseyside Police with their efforts to find the man. On 4 November 2017 the investigation was regraded as high risk due to the passage of time, and the fact that the man had not accessed money and that his mobile phone had been disconnected since the evening of 29 October.

The man was walking slightly ahead of his wife and did not notice her having an epileptic seizure and falling to the ground. He turned round and started walking towards her. At that point two men and a woman joined her to provide assistance. One of the men was an off-duty West Yorkshire Police special constable, who thought that the man was drunk and may have assaulted his wife. The man had an altercation with the special constable, which escalated quickly. The special constable believed the man may assault him and restrained him by taking him to the ground.\\nTwo British Transport Police community support officers (PCSOs) were called to assist with what they were told was a possible assault by the man against his wife. One of the officers handcuffed the man and detained him so that the man could explain what had happened. The man’s wife confirmed that she had epilepsy. The man complained that his leg was hurting and might be broken. An ambulance was called and the man was taken to hospital, where it was confirmed that he had sustained a serious break to his leg, which required surgery and a long period of rehabilitation.\\nThe man made a complaint regarding the incident, alleging that the officer had used unreasonable and unnecessary force.\\nThe force referred this to us as a complaint matter on 26 July 2017.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators took statements from a number of witnesses, including police officers, members of the public and ambulance staff.

Officers attempted to sit him down on a bench within the cell. The man fell backwards and slid down toward the floor, banging his head on the wall and the bench.

The man was then carried to a cell and, after being searched by the officers, he was left there alone, unrestrained and face down.\\nShortly afterwards, the man became unwell again. An ambulance was called and the man was taken to hospital. The hospital doctor was not informed about him hitting his head, signs of fitting, unconsciousness or that incapacitant spray had been used on him.

The man was interviewed and bailed to return to the police station in 18 days. He was bailed to an address eight doors away from his ex-partner, with conditions not to enter her road or contact her directly or indirectly. She was assessed as a high-risk domestic abuse victim.\\nTwo days after his arrest, the man allegedly breached his bail conditions by contacting his ex-partner and turning up at her address. She provided a statement, but no other action was taken by police in relation to this.\\xa0\\nOn his bail-to-return date, the man was re-bailed by the investigating officer instead of being charged for the offences. The next day, both the man and the woman were found dead.

Misconduct was found to be not proven at the meeting and no further action was taken.\\nAnother officer was subject to a misconduct (instead of gross misconduct) meeting in respect of seven allegations. At the meeting, four of the allegations were found proven, including taking no action against the man in light of evidence that he had breached bail conditions, failing to progress the matter, and failing to make a referral to the Crown Prosecution Service. The officer was given a written warning.\\nAnother officer attended a misconduct meeting, where three out of four allegations were found proven, including failing to adequately supervise the case and the investigating officer, and failing to manage bail periods effectively and the breach of bail.

Four officers arrived at the man’s house, but he refused to allow them in and was allegedly abusive towards the officers. After asking the man several times to open the door, the officers decided to force entry, as they were concerned that someone inside may be requiring urgent assistance. As officers were trying to get inside the house through the door, the man kicked the hand of one of the officers.\\nWhen inside, two officers used force to tackle the man to the ground and restrain him, as he was behaving in an aggressive manner. The other two officers assisted in applying handcuffs and limb restraints to the man. He was then arrested and transported to custody, where he made a complaint of excessive force during his arrest.

The officer continued to travel in the direction the car had been heading and, immediately after emerging round a bend in the road, came across the car. It had collided with the gable end of a house.

Officers arrived at the man’s home within 30 minutes. The attending officers administrated first aid to a superficial cut and took the man to Burnley General Hospital at his own request.\\nOn 12 February 2016 the NWAS contacted Lancashire Constabulary again requesting police attendance at an address in Colne. Police were told a man had spoken to his girlfriend and that she had said she was going to commit suicide. Officers who went to the woman’s home subsequently established from her that it was her boyfriend who had intimated suicide. An urgent welfare check was requested at the man’s home in Burnley.\\nA Burnley officer arrived at the man’s home within minutes of being dispatched to the incident. The officer spoke to the man outside his home, who assured him he was not going to take his own life. The man told the officer he had said he would take his own life in response to his girlfriend saying it first. The officer resumed duties after speaking to the man.\\nOn 13 April the man’s (by then former) girlfriend called Lancashire Constabulary reporting concern for him. Officers forced entry at his flat and found him dead on the stairs. This was the same man the police had previous contact with on 10 and 12 February.\\nDuring the investigation, statements were obtained from the officers who went to the man’s home on 10 February 2016. Investigators also interviewed the control room operator and officer who went to the man’s house on 12 February. The investigation obtained witness statements in relation to processes involved in protecting vulnerable people, and from the man’s former partner.\\nBased on the evidence available the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that the performance of a police dispatcher may be considered unsatisfactory on 12 February for not relaying to officers that the man had mental health issues and had been previously taken to hospital in similar circumstances.\\nThe Lead Investigator was also of the opinion that a tribunal may find that a member of police staff had a case to answer for misconduct for failing to read the incident log, carrying out adequate checks and relaying relevant information to another officer on 12 February, and that the performance of a police officer may have been unsatisfactory on the same date.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the force disagreed that the member of police staff had a case to answer for misconduct and suggested this was a performance issue that they would deal with through learning and improvement. They were also of the view that a second control room operator and police officer who attended the scene on 12 February did not have a case to answer for misconduct.\\nAfter considering their rationale we agreed that their proposals were appropriate.\\nThis investigation highlighted the need for Lancashire Constabulary to raise awareness and ensure understanding of the benefits of the broadcast feature to call handling and control room staff: this is to ensure that important/pertinent information added by call handlers is flagged up to the dispatcher and relayed in turn to the officer.\\nWe also suggested the force audit the effectiveness of their training in processes used to protect vulnerable people.\\nThe force agreed with these recommendations and advised that they had already implemented some of that learning.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Lancashire Constabulary']}\n",

When they arrived, a man was inside the flat and his mother, who was outside, provided keys to officers and gave them permission to enter her home. The man allegedly made threats to harm officers should they enter the property and officers called for other units to attend.\\nOther officers arrived and entered the flat, where the man was arrested. He began to resist and was later found guilty in parallel criminal proceedings of assaulting one police officer by biting them and assaulting another officer by head-butting them during the incident. The man’s eye socket was broken during the incident. The man alleged that he had been taken to the floor in a choke-hold and repeatedly punched and kicked in the head and face by officers while on the floor. The man also alleged that he was arrested unlawfully, that excessive force was used when officers applied handcuffs and that the officers’ actions were motivated by discrimination based on his ethnicity and his mother’s mental health condition.\\nDuring the investigation the man and his mother were interviewed and we obtained and examined medical evidence as well as a medical expert’s report. Investigators also obtained and examined call logs, airwave recordings, police van CCTV and the evidence heard at court during the parallel proceedings against the man.\\nThe investigation found an indication that one officer had committed grievous bodily harm and gross misconduct, and four other officers had committed actual bodily harm and gross misconduct against the man.

Two officers attended the address shortly afterwards. The information available to officers when they arrived indicated that there had been a verbal altercation between the brother and sister which had escalated, and the woman had bitten her brother on the finger. Body-worn video footage shows that one officer remained in the house with the brother while the other officer went out into the back garden to locate the woman, who was attempting to climb over the garden fence, out onto the street. The officer then approached the woman in the street outside the address, and attempted to speak to her about why she had called police. The woman appeared visibly confused and did not answer the officer’s questions.\\nBody-worn video footage shows that, while the officer was speaking with the woman, she had something in her hand and put her hand in her jacket pocket. The officer said that he thought the woman may have had a weapon, so he asked her to remove her hand from her pocket. The woman failed to comply with the command and officers then attempted to restrain her. Body-worn video footage shows that it took several minutes for the officers to apply handcuffs as the woman struggled with officers, attempted to strike out at them, grabbed one of the officers by the wrist and attempted to bite both officers several times.\\nThroughout the restraint, the woman said repeatedly that she was pregnant and was having a miscarriage. The officers stated that they were aware she may have been pregnant and they attempted to avoid contact with her stomach as much as possible. Body-worn video footage also shows that the woman was holding on to one of the officer’s wrist and would not let go. The officer delivered several distraction strikes to the woman’s head and upper body, which, she said, were the only places she could reach at that point. Body-worn video footage shows that there was a pause of one to two seconds between each strike but the woman continued to hold on to the officer’s wrist.\\nOnce the woman was handcuffed, the officers informed her that she was under arrest on suspicion of assaulting her brother and assault against the police. Three further officers arrived and requested an ambulance, which arrived shortly afterwards. The woman was taken to hospital for a mental health assessment, and subsequently taken to custody. A physical examination was conducted and the woman sustained superficial injuries to her right knee and right cheek.\\nThe woman later complained that that the officers had attacked her without asking any questions, and punched her to the face, even though she was the one who called the police originally.\\nOur investigators reviewed body-worn camera footage of the incident and obtained accounts from the attending officers.

The custody sergeant authorised the man’s detention and conducted a risk assessment.

The custody sergeant placed the man on general observation with 30-minute welfare visits and a healthcare professional was requested to assess the man’s fitness to be detained.\\nThe man was subject to a cursory search and placed in a cell. A short time later, he was found to have self-harmed using a sharp object, causing serious injuries. He was given medical assistance and transferred to hospital for treatment.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators examined CCTV footage from the custody centre, reviewed police documentation, and obtained witness accounts from the healthcare professional and other police witnesses. They also reviewed relevant policies and guidance documentation.\\nThe Investigator found that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct for one detention officer for failing to conduct a thorough welfare visit, failing to seek medical assistance for the man, and failing to update the custody sergeant in respect of the man’s condition.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the force agreed to hold a misconduct meeting for the detention officer. At the meeting the detention officer received a verbal warning.\\nAs a result of our investigation, we recommended that the force update their standard operating procedure, which they agreed to do. It now specifically references official professional practice, and includes the definition of an adverse incident.

The officers informed the man that they needed to get him on to the ambulance. The man resisted, but allowed the officers to sit him down and place a seatbelt on him. The man moved backwards and forwards against the seatbelt and shouted at officers and paramedics, so one of the officers stayed with the man in the ambulance and the other followed in a patrol car.\\nDuring the journey the man became more agitated and the officer on board felt that the man was putting himself at risk by moving back and forth against the seatbelt while the ambulance was moving at speed with the emergency lights on.

One officer assisted paramedics in restraining the man on the bed so that the doctor could insert a cannula and sedate the man. The man resisted during the restraint and the officer, paramedic and hospital staff held him down on the bed during sedation. Once the man was sedated the officers left the hospital. It was later established that the man had sustained a broken shoulder.\\nDuring the course of the investigation, we obtained accounts from a number of officers and witnesses, analysed video and documentary evidence from Bedfordshire Police and examined Bedfordshire Police’s policies, specifically those relevant to dealing with mental health.\\nAt the end of the investigation, the Lead Investigator found no indication that the actions of the police caused or contributed to the injury to the man.

The recovery worker had received a phone call from one of the other residents in the flats where the man lived. The recovery worker said he had been told that the man could be heard in his flat screaming and shouting with loud music playing. The caller mentioned that the man was known to have mental health issues. An ambulance was requested by GMP.\\nOfficers went to the man’s flat and tried to gain entry to the building. There was no response from the residents when they tried the buzzers. While they were there, officers made two calls to the recovery worker. One of the officers provided an update saying it was quiet, no lights were on and nothing was going on. The recovery worker raised no concerns and so the ambulance was cancelled and the incident log closed.\\nOn 1 November 2016, the man’s mother contacted GMP to say she was concerned about him after receiving a voicemail left by her son at 8.52pm the night before. Officers went to the man’s home with his mother and found him dead in his flat. The man’s mother alleged an inappropriate comment was made to her by one of the officers during their interaction.\\nDuring the investigation, we took a witness statement from the recovery worker. We obtained a recording of the worker’s call to GMP, along with radio transmissions.

GMP considered prevention and education to be an appropriate and non-detrimental approach to the issues highlighted regarding the radio operators. We agreed this was appropriate.\\nIn relation to the comments the man’s mother alleged were made to her, the officer was served with a notice of investigation. The officer confirmed that she did make an inappropriate comment, but not to the extent described by the mother. CCTV and body-worn video was obtained, but the footage had not captured the comment.

When they arrived a man reported that his partner had assaulted him. The couple were known to Northumbria Police for a number of reports of domestic assaults on each other and a history of alcohol abuse.\\nThe man’s partner was arrested and taken to custody. He had a seizure shortly after being placed in a holding cell and was taken to hospital for treatment. No custody record was created by Northumbria Police.\\nThe man remained in hospital under arrest with officers present. Later that day, the hospital advised that the man could not be released and needed to remain in hospital for three days. As this would have required an officer sitting with the man during the whole of that time, the escorting officer was directed by a supervising officer to use ‘street bail’ to release the man from police custody. Legislation applicable to such circumstances does not allow ‘street bail’ to be granted. Even so, the man was released from custody on bail while at the hospital, without any conditions being attached to ensure the safeguarding of the victim. He remained in hospital for further treatment and discharged himself after two days.\\nTwo days later, Northumbria Police received a report that the man who had reported the assault had been assaulted and found unconscious in his home with serious head injuries. He subsequently died.

They handcuffed him, as they were concerned that his behaviour was “volatile and aggressive”. Once placed in the police van, the man asked for his medication. One of the officers went to look, but said she couldn’t find it.\\nAt 1.14 am, the man was presented to the custody desk. He complained that he had injuries to his wrists caused by the handcuffs. He also told the custody officer that he was on medication for anxiety and depression and was overdue to take this, and requested a doctor.\\nThe man’s medication arrived at the police station at 6.23am. When the custody nurse practitioner (CNP) started her shift at 7.30 am, she told the man she could not administer his medication and had asked a doctor to do this.\\nAt 10.45am the man and an appropriate adult saw the forensic medical examiner (FME), who administered the man’s medications and deemed him fit for interview.\\nWhen the man was taken back to his cell after being interviewed, CCTV shows him to be unsteady on his feet, and holding his stomach as he entered the cell.\\nAt 12.59pm, the CNP was concerned that the man had an opiate overdose and called the FME. An ambulance was called. Two paramedics arrived within half an hour and the man was taken to hospital. He went into respiratory arrest but subsequently stabilised.\\nThe man was returned to custody at 9.34pm. He was assessed by an FME, who deemed him fit for custody and suggested his fitness for charge be reviewed at 8am.\\nThe custody officer charged the man at 6.10am on 2 July and refused him bail. At 8.26am the man was released from custody to attend court.\\nThe man subsequently made a number of allegations about the actions of police officers following his arrest and detention relating to: excessive use of force, failure to record information, failure to provide appropriate medication and care, excessive detention and the conducting of an interview while the complainant was unfit.\\nThe complaints were initially referred to us by the MPS in August 2014 and we instructed the MPS to investigate these locally. The MPS investigation concluded in March 2016, and the complainant appealed to us as regards the findings.

The paramedics were dealing with a man suffering from a mental health crisis. \\xa0The paramedics gave the officers an overview of the situation and explained that the man may react aggressively to the officers’ presence. Officers did not enter the man’s flat. They left after having a discussion with the paramedics and members of the man’s family. The paramedics started to make arrangements for the man to receive a mental health assessment.\\nAt 00.13am on 3 March, a neighbour contacted the MPS reporting the man’s front door was ajar and items strewn outside. Two further MPS officers attended the address. They found the man lying in his bed with his eyes open, but he would not respond to them. Officers commented that there was smell of burning or gas in the flat. The body-worn camera footage shows officers looking though the whole flat. They didn’t find the source of the smell.\\nThe officers consulted with a supervisor and were informed of the man’s criminal history and potential risk to them. The officers immediately left the flat, leaving the front door open. They secured the communal entrance to the block of flats. At around 6am, one of the man’s neighbours on his way to work saw that the man’s flat door was still open and went into the flat. He found the man in the kitchen, rolling a cigarette and spoke briefly to him before leaving. The neighbour noticed no particular disturbance or smell.\\nShortly before 11am, members of the public reported a fire in a flat – this was the man’s flat. London Fire Brigade attended the address and found the man unconscious. He was taken to hospital but later died.\\nInvestigators attended the scene and obtained witness accounts from police officers, paramedics and the neighbour. Police officers’ body-worn camera footage was analysed and the subject officers interviewed.\\nAt the conclusion of the investigation, the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that a reasonable panel, properly directed would find that the second pair of attending officers had a case to answer for gross misconduct in respect of their apparent failure to carry out their duties and responsibilities, and a case to answer for misconduct in relation to their failure to record the incident.\\nThe Lead Investigator was also of the opinion that a reasonable panel, properly directed would find that the officers’ supervisor had a case to answer for gross misconduct for failing to consider the welfare of the man and failing to record any justification of his alleged decision to withdraw officers from the flat.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the force did not agree with the Lead Investigator’s view regarding the severity of the allegations. They provided us with a rationale as to why they should hold misconduct (and not gross misconduct) proceedings for the three officers.

A police driving expert, asked to comment on the actions of the officer, concluded that this was not a pursuit.\\nBased on the available evidence, the Investigator was of the opinion that this was not a pursuit as defined by the MPS Policy and the College of Policing. The officer made no request of the motorcyclist to stop at the time the motorcyclist made off at speed. The distances between the police vehicle and the motorcyclist throughout the journey were not considered as ‘maintaining contact’ as mentioned in the MPS pursuit policy. The investigator was also of the opinion that the officer’s decision to follow the motorcyclist and to try to catch up with him was reasonable in view of the speed at which the motorcyclist was riding.\\nThe Investigator did not consider that the actions of the police officer caused or contributed to the collision.

The report was graded as a low-risk missing person.\\nThe woman had what was described as a chaotic lifestyle, had issues with drugs and other health matters. She had recently been released from prison prior to going missing. The mother had been communicating with her daughter via text, but she became suspicious that the text messages were not actually from her daughter, as the style they were written in were not the same as previous ones.\\nIn August 2013, the investigation was upgraded to a medium-risk missing person as she had been missing for some time.\\nMissing person enquiries lead to two persons who associated with the woman.\\xa0 It was believed that these two persons might have been claiming the benefits belonging to her. Officers attended the address of the couple on a number of occasions in order to continue enquiries to locate the woman.

The custody sergeant authorised a strip search of the woman, as she had numerous warning markers on police systems indicating that she had previously harmed herself and had concealed items while in custody.\\nThe woman was subject to a strip search, during which she attempted to consume tablets concealed in her clothing on two occasions. No other items of significance were found during the strip search.\\nThe woman was placed on level 3 observations (constant observations via CCTV) and was taken to a cell. However, CCTV indicates that, within a few seconds of her cell door closing, she had removed a knife which she had concealed internally and used it to harm herself by cutting her wrists. She was then taken to hospital, and returned to the custody suite a few hours later.\\nDuring the investigation, our investigators reviewed CCTV footage of the woman in custody, together with her custody record, and obtained a statement from the officer who arrested her. The Custody Sergeant was interviewed under misconduct caution about his decision to authorise a strip search rather than an intimate search, as well as regarding the allocation of CCTV monitoring duties, as there was no evidence that he had allocated this task to any member of staff.\\nDuring his interview, he stated that he had allocated the CCTV monitoring role to a named member of staff, who was subsequently also interviewed under misconduct caution. The investigation found that the Custody Sergeant had allocated the role, albeit with a slight delay, during which time Ms Jones was able to self-harm. It also found that the decision not to conduct an intimate search did not breach any policies.\\nThe Investigator found no indication that any person serving with the police may have committed a criminal offence or behaved in a manner that would justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Gwent Police']}\n",

The woman shouted further abuse at the officer, waved her hand – which was bloody – in his face and appeared to be threatening to slap him.

The man was also said to be violent. Police escorted the man to his home address. While this was occurring, a support worker from the man’s assisted accommodation had also rang Merseyside Police to report the man as missing.\\nPatrols arrived at the home address, and the support worker explained that the man needed to take his medication. The officers agreed to wait outside, so as not to cause any further distress to the man, and in case the support worker needed further assistance.\\nA short while later the support worker requested the police’s assistance as the man was trying to get into the rooms of other service users. The man was then arrested for a breach of the peace and taken into custody. Police officers confirmed that, as they were transporting the man to custody, he started to bang his head against the van and to try to bite his arms. While in the holding area, the man became agitated and wanted to lie on the floor. The officers assisted him to the floor while protecting his head. The man was snoring loudly and kicking out randomly while on the floor. Officers placed him in the recovery position. Officers state that they then noticed the man had stopped breathing, and immediately started chest compressions while waiting for paramedics to take him to hospital.\\nThe paramedics arrived and the man regained consciousness and appeared calm. However, while being transported to hospital, the man began kicking out again, and so leg restraints were placed on him by officers. They were taken off a short while later when he had calmed down. While in hospital the man started to kick out again and officers assisted medical staff in restraining him while he was sedated. The man was later discharged from hospital.\\nBased on the evidence available, the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that there was no indication of any misconduct or criminality in relation to the extent of Merseyside Police’s contact with the man. There was no evidence to suggest that the man should have been dealt with in any other way other than being taken to custody after his arrest for breaching the peace.\\nA learning recommendation was made to the force to ensure that all officers are reminded of the need to place detainees in the recovery position at the earliest opportunity and are made aware of snoring being a possible risk factor of positional asphyxia.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Custody and detention', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Merseyside Police']}\n",

When the emergency services arrived, life support was started and continued in the ambulance on the way to hospital, where the man died an hour later.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed the call handler, examined documents relating to the call and obtained statements from several witnesses.\\nThe Investigator formed the opinion that there was sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct in relation to the call handler’s direction to the caller to not make attempts to cut the man down. This is because there was information available to her which suggested the man may have still been alive. The call handler also passed misleading information to the London Ambulance Service about the man’s condition, based on an assumption that he was already dead.\\nAfter reviewing our report, the MPS agreed the call handler had a case to answer for misconduct and held a misconduct meeting.

The woman and her sons were in the car park of Thorpe Park, Staines-upon-Thames. The man felt his daughter was acting strangely, and believed she may have been drunk, suffering a mental disorder or had taken the wrong mix of prescription drugs. He told her she must not drive the car in any circumstances and called 999 for assistance.\\nSurrey Police officers were deployed to the scene. The first police officer to arrive said he could smell alcohol on the woman’s breath and that she was slurring her words. At 7.20pm the officer arrested the woman on suspicion of child neglect, He cautioned her and handcuffed her to the rear. During the process, the woman fell to the ground and the officer used his radio to ask the control room for additional support. The woman remained restrained on the ground.\\nMore officers arrived, in a marked police van.\\nThe woman was placed into the police van and transported to Staines custody suite. The evidence suggests the woman resisted closure of the inner doors of the van’s celled area by placing her foot against the door. Force was then used by officers to force the door closed while the woman still resisted. One of the officers commented at that point he heard the woman scream and start crying.\\nUpon arrival at the custody suite the woman again complained of pain to her leg and was unable to walk. A police doctor came to the van, examined the woman and directed officers to take her straight to hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the woman’s leg was x-rayed and it was determined she had a fracture to just below her left knee joint, for which she would require reparative surgery.\\nInvestigators reviewed CCTV footage from Thorpe Park’s car park and from the van deck area at Staines police station; they interviewed the woman’s eldest son and an officer who travelled with the woman to the hospital. The five officers who were present at the incident were interviewed under misconduct caution. Medical evidence about the woman’s injuries was also obtained.\\nBased on the evidence available, the Investigator was of the opinion that a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could conclude that three officers had a case to answer for gross misconduct for use of force against the woman and inappropriate level of aftercare, and a fourth officer a case to answer for inappropriate level of aftercare.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Surrey Police agreed with our findings and held a misconduct hearing in respect of the four officers. At the meeting the panel concluded that securing the van door was a legitimate objective, it was reasonable that officers exerted pressure in closing and not re-opening it.

The police officer tried to locate the woman; he visited her home address on two occasions; he conducted enquiries on police computer systems; he contacted the hospital; he spoke with several people to try and identify the woman’s whereabouts. He also confirmed the location of the woman’s daughter.\\nOn 6 December 2015 officers returned to the woman’s home. Following unsuccessful attempts to contact her, they forced entry to her property, where she was found hanging.\\nOur report was finalised on 16 February 2017. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide at an inquest held early in 2018.\\nDuring the investigation, we served notices of investigation to the call handler who received the initial concern for safety report and also to the police officer deployed to respond to the incident on 5 December 2015. We obtained accounts from both of them, took statements from witnesses, obtained call recordings and reviewed incident logs.\\nOn the basis of the evidence available, the Lead Investigator was of the opinion that the call handler and the police officer both had a case to answer.\\nFollowing discussion with the force, it was agreed that the performance of the police officer did not constitute misconduct, but that it was unsatisfactory. That related to his failure to make further enquiries to locate the woman during his shift on 5–6 December. He was dealt with by means of supervisory management action.\\nThe call handler attended a misconduct meeting. Misconduct was proven against the call handler for failing to record and document some of the information provided in the report from the hospital. The sanction provided was management advice.\\nThe investigation highlighted some learning, which we shared with North Wales Police.\\nWe recommended that they draft and circulate throughout the force a concern for welfare policy. We also suggested that the force may wish to consider drafting and submitting guidance to officers and operators regarding the process of requesting an incident to be held – an incident is ‘held’ when it has been resourced and is then deferred for a later time to be dealt with.\\nNorth Wales Police reviewed their working practices in respect of both recommendations.

While at the address the officers undertook a number of enquiries. However, they did not force entry to the property.

While they were waiting for the police to arrive, they forced entry to the property, where the man was found dead in a bedroom.\\nDuring the investigation, investigators interviewed the call handler, police officers and support staff involved in the incident.

The Investigator did find that Merseyside Police did not respond in a timely manner to calls made on the 25 October 2016.\\nAfter reviewing our report, Merseyside Police proposed to deal with this through management action and a development plan (including learning), for the call handler. We agreed that their proposals were appropriate.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Death and serious injury', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Merseyside Police']}\n",

The caller reported that a male resident had broken a window, was behaving in a disruptive manner and appeared to be intoxicated.\\nThe caller indicated that a man was “terrorising other clients at the moment, he’s broke [sic] a window in one of the client’s doors”. The caller stated that the man was “drunk at the moment” and that he had been “banging on other doors, he’s been trying to climb through windows, he’s smashed a back window in one of the other client’s apartments”. When the police operator asked whether the man was “still kicking up at the moment?’’ The caller stated that “he’s simmered down at the moment but we don’t feel safe, some of the clients don’t feel safe and are vulnerable here, so it’s best probably take him off the premises as soon as possible”.\\nPolice officers attended and arrested the man, who was subsequently Tasered. The man was interviewed and charged with offences of criminal damage and assault police.\\nThe man attended Bristol Magistrates’ Court, where the defence produced CCTV of the incident. Following an assessment of the footage by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), it was decided that the footage did not appear consistent with the police officers’ statements. The CPS offered no evidence and both charges were dismissed.\\xa0\\nThis matter came to our attention on 9 December 2015, as the man’s mother had submitted a complaint alleging that excessive force was used on her son, who had learning difficulties, and that the officers had lied in their statements. We conducted an independent investigation and interviewed the attending officers in relation to the allegations.\\nInvestigators obtained accounts from the reporting person, employees of the supported accommodation and police officers. They also examined documentation, the relevant policies and procedures, and CCTV footage of the incident.\\nAt the end of the investigation, after having analysed all the evidence, the Lead Investigator concluded that, in her opinion, the force used to detain and arrest the man was reasonable, in view of the reported incident and his behaviour when officers interacted with him. In the Lead Investigator’s view, the evidence gathered during our investigation clearly suggested that the man had refused to be arrested. Save that they were attending a “residential care-type address”, the officers had no prior knowledge of the man or his particular needs and vulnerabilities. In the Lead Investigator’s view, it was reasonable for officers to seek an account from the man about his behaviour after he had been arrested and once he no longer posed a risk to himself or others.\\nHaving taken into account the whole of the CCTV footage together with the evidence described above, the Lead Investigator considered that the man’s physical size, unpredictable behaviour (in terms of his words and actions) and intoxication may have presented a risk both to the man himself and the police officers if other options such as incapacitant spray, a baton or physical restraint, were attempted. The Taser was discharged once for a duration of five seconds, after the man had made an attempt to run off, tripped over himself, and as he was attempting to get back up again. In the Lead Investigator’s view, there was no evidence to suggest that the police officers used more force than they honestly and instinctively considered necessary to effect the arrest.\\nIt was the Lead Investigator’s view that there was no indication the officers’ statements, which refer to a two-handed push, were written to intentionally mislead or misrepresent the incident. It did not necessarily follow that, because the CPS discontinued proceedings against the man, the officers used excessive force. It was the Lead Investigator’s opinion that, while there is some ambiguity as to the specific nature of the physical contact between the man and the police officer, the CCTV footage indicates that there was sufficient contact to cause the officer to step back and therefore the officers’ recollection of events is not irreconcilable with the CCTV footage.\\nIn the Lead Investigator’s view, there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal, properly directed, could find misconduct or gross misconduct for the officers involved. Further, we found no indication that any person serving with the police may have committed a criminal offence.\\nThe Lead Investigator also concluded that, in her opinion, another officer’s performance in relation to securing and preserving the CCTV evidence of the incident may have fallen below the standard required. Avon and Somerset Constabulary agreed, and confirmed that the report would be shared with the officer’s line manager to ensure that an appropriate plan could be put in place.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Use of force and armed policing', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Avon and Somerset Constabulary']}\n",

Ms A subsequently informed an officer that she did not wish to make a complaint regarding this matter as she was trying to resolve the matter amicably.\\nOn 21 August 2016, a relative of Ms A’s contacted South Wales Police to raise similar concerns and was told that the matter concerning the loan for the motorbike was a civil matter. The relative said that Mr B was making threats against Ms A. However, no police incident log was created and no officers were allocated to respond.\\nAt 12.02am on 22 August 2016, another friend of Ms A, Mr C, called 999. He said that he was with Ms A in her car, which she was driving, and that they were being pursued by another vehicle containing Ms D (Mr B’s former partner) and a relative of Mr B’s, Ms E. Two minutes later, Mr C said that the pursuing vehicle had disappeared. The 999 call, during which Mr C and Ms A provided information regarding the loan for the motorbike and alleged that Ms E and Ms D had threatened Ms A on the instruction of Mr B, lasted for 24 minutes. The call handler told Ms A on a number of occasions that she should not have taken out the loan. At the end of the call he allocated the incident a \"scheduled\" grading, meaning that a response was required within 24 hours.\\nAt 12.34am, Mr C called 999 again and was connected to a different call handler. He said that they were now being chased by two vehicles. The call handler began to take initial details, but within one minute the vehicle which Ms A was driving had crashed. Ms A was killed and Mr C sustained life-changing injuries. Ms D and Mr B were subsequently convicted of causing the death of Ms A and the injuries to Mr C by dangerous driving.\\nThe investigation analysed police incident logs, the audio of radio and telephone communications and evidence from the criminal investigation relating to Mr B and Ms D. The investigation obtained written accounts from the call handlers who dealt with the initial two calls made on 21 and 22 August, transmissions from these calls were obtained as well as those of the collision. Written accounts were obtained from the officers who dealt with the previous report relating to Ms A on 16 August.\\nThe Lead Investigator concluded that, in her opinion, a police staff call handler had a case to answer for misconduct based on an apparent failure to link appropriate persons to the incident log, failing to administratively finalise the call log accordingly and displaying apparent dismissiveness in dealing with the callers.\\xa0\\nIn addition the Lead Investigator highlighted potential performance issues in respect of two other officers involved in earlier reports, which in brief related to apparent failures to accord with the principles of domestic abuse procedures. South Wales Police agreed to address these performances issues with the two officers.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['South Wales Police', 'Welfare and vulnerable people', 'Death and serious injury']}\n",

The intelligence checks did not identify any information about the girl.\\nThe officers gave the girl a lift to an address that she stated was her cousin’s, where she was meant to be staying. The officers waited until the girl had been greeted by a boy, who looked approximately 16 years old. After the officers left, they received intelligence that the information the girl provided in respect of her age was false. The officers spoke with the girl’s parents, who confirmed she was 14 years old and that the boy was not their daughter’s cousin. The officers returned to the address where they had left the girl and drove her back to her parents’ home. The girl reported the next day she had been sexually assaulted by the boy at the address.\\nDuring the investigation, attempts were made to speak with the girl and her parents. However, they did not engage with the investigators. During interview with the police the girl confirmed she had provided false information to the officers.\\nThe officers provided written accounts of their actions.

Following arrest, the defendant was conveyed to the custody suite at Bromley Police Station, where his detention was authorised. While in custody, the defendant complained to custody staff that his hand was broken. His injury was assessed by a staff nurse, but he waited a number of hours before receiving medical attention or pain relief. The defendant was eventually taken to hospital by the police, and given treatment for a fractured right hand. On 24 October 2015, the defendant made a complaint to the MPS, alleging his injury was caused by police officers while in police custody.

This included CCTV footage of the incident, witness statements, police airwaves, and relevant policies and procedures relating to the use of force.

It was alleged that, in the course of the search, one of the officers struck the teenager several times and swore at the teenager. Mobile phone footage of part of the incident was recorded by a witness to the incident. An edited version of the footage was subsequently distributed on social media, leading to significant coverage in print, broadcast and social media.\\nIt later transpired that the officer who struck the teenager had recorded footage of the incident on his police issued body-worn video camera but had subsequently deleted the footage. It also came to light that the officers’ supervisor had viewed the footage but took no steps to enquire about the officer’s use of force, or to preserve the footage.\\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began an independent investigation following a referral from the force, and served notices on the two officers who attended the incident, and their supervisor. During the investigation, investigators obtained the complete mobile phone footage of the incident, obtained medical evidence, instructed experts, interviewed witnesses and examined various devices including the officers’ body-worn video cameras. The IPCC was unable to recover the deleted body-worn video camera footage, which apparently captured some of the incident but not the physical strikes. The two officers who attended the address in Northampton were interviewed under a misconduct caution. The officers’ supervisor was asked, under a misconduct caution, to provide a written account to questions posed to him.\\nAt the end of the investigation, after having analysed all the evidence, the lead investigator concluded that, in his opinion, the officer who struck the teenager had a case to answer for gross misconduct. The lead investigator also concluded that, in his opinion, the officers’ supervisor had a case to answer for misconduct. The appropriate authority (Northamptonshire Police) and the IPCC commissioner agreed with the investigator that the supervisor had a case to answer for misconduct. However, the appropriate authority’s assessment of the conduct of the officer who struck the teenager was that, if proven, it would amount to misconduct only. The IPCC commissioner agreed with the appropriate authority.\\nNorthamptonshire Police agreed with the IPCC that the student constable had no case to answer for failing to report and challenge improper conduct, unlawful search, unlawful detention, and failing to record use of force.\\nFollowing a misconduct meeting convened by Northamptonshire Police, the officer who struck the teenager was given a written warning for failing to treat the teenager with respect and courtesy by using inappropriate language, failing to properly record use of force, and deleting his bodyworn video camera footage in contravention of force policy and guidance. The misconduct meeting did not find that there had been any other breaches of the standards of professional behaviour.\\nThe officers’ supervisor was subject to management action for not exercising sufficiently intrusive supervision after having viewed bodyworn video camera footage of the incident.\\nThe IPCC referred the conduct of the officer who struck the teenager to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision on assault, but the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction for the offence.\\nIn the course of the investigation, it came to light that the systems in place in Northamptonshire Police allowed officers to delete footage from their issued body-worn video cameras without having to first upload the footage onto force systems. The IPCC therefore recommended that the force implement a system whereby footage cannot be deleted without an audit trail. In response, Northamptonshire Police has taken steps to address this issue, including issuing updated guidance on handling body-worn video camera footage to officers.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Northamptonshire Police']}\n",

The lead investigator raised potential performance concerns regarding the fact that the two custody sergeants did not request an ambulance sooner despite the fact that one of them suspected that the man may be suffering from this condition.\\nThe IPCC Commission delegate accepted the determination of South Wales Police that the officers involved should receive operational advice.\\nThe IPCC recommended that officers and staff working in South Wales Police custody suites should be given clearer guidance regarding what constitutes “prolonged restraint” in custody and the requirement specified in national police guidance to treat any case of ongoing restraint involving mental health concerns as a medical emergency. South Wales Police have since consulted with medical experts and developed further guidance in this area.\\nThe IPCC recommended that South Wales Police training material should be updated to reflect national guidance that any detainee with a suspected head injury should be taken directly to hospital.\\nThe investigation also examined the training of South Wales Police custody sergeants and whether they had been informed of a requirement to comply with national police guidance on detention and custody. The IPCC recommended that this requirement should be made clearer in the training and communications to custody officers and staff and that they should be specifically informed of major updates to national guidance in this area.\\nSouth Wales Police has accepted all of the above recommendations.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['South Wales Police']}\n",

During the investigation, particular emphasis was placed on the communication between the two police forces and the decision-making process throughout the missing person investigation.\\nA misconduct notice was served to an MPS officer working as a call operator in relation to a failure to pass the details of the two addresses through to the local borough.\\nThe investigation found there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could conclude the officer had a case to answer for misconduct. The MPS call handler misunderstood the reasons for the checks he conducted and didn’t consider it necessary to pass the result through to the local borough. The investigation found evidence of poor communication between the forces and made two learning recommendations to Cambridgeshire Constabulary and a further two learning recommendations to MPS as a result of this investigation.\\n', 'recsheading': '', 'recommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation': '', 'dateofrecommendation_stamp': '', 'dateresponsedue': '', 'dateresponsedue_stamp': '', 'accepted': '', 'reclink': '', 'tags': ['Cambridgeshire Constabulary', 'Metropolitan Police']}\n",

The police dog had been deployed by a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer as part of a training exercise taking place at a former theme park, adjacent to the hotel and separated by fencing.\\nWhen the GMP officer found the man and the police dog, they were on the hotel side of the fence. At this stage the dog was still biting the man, which caused a number of puncture wounds, and a substantial tear wound. Hotel staff provided first aid care.\\nThe man was arrested on suspicion of going equipped to steal from the theme park site after the man gave an inconsistent story as to why he was in the hotel car park and wire cutters were discovered in his car. A pile of scrap metal had been found close to a hole in the fence and the man’s mobile also reportedly located on the theme park side of the fence.\\nLancashire Constabulary officers took over from GMP at the scene. The complainant was later de-arrested and taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries. No further action was taken by Lancashire Constabulary due to lack of substantial evidence.\\nThe man made a number of complaints to us on 4 July 2016 regarding the incident, including allegations that he had been subject to grievous bodily harm (GBH) due to the reckless conduct of the officers and was further traumatised due to the fact he was arrested and afforded no form of first aid from any GMP officer.\\nDuring the investigation, accounts were obtained from all of the police officers present on the training day.

The Lead Investigator also concluded that none of the police staff involved had a case to answer for misconduct.\\nLearnings were identified for control room staff regarding their handling of calls relating to firearms.

One of the police officers and a neighbour asked the woman to allow the fire service to rescue her, but the woman threatened to jump if the fire service intervened. One of the officers asked that the police negotiator be made aware of the incident.\\nThe woman, dressed in flip flops and a long summer dress, walked along the rooftop of the terraced properties. She was very unsteady on her feet. Both police officers stated they were concerned that she might fall. The woman sat down but became agitated and stood up again. She stumbled backwards and began to roll off the roof, but caught herself using her hands.\\nA police sergeant attended to take control of the incident. He arranged the closure of roads in the vicinity. He saw the woman stumbling and was concerned that due to her unsteadiness on the roof she may fall. He was equally concerned that, due to her threats to kill herself and her mental state, she may jump. His assessment was therefore that action was needed, and he asked the fire officer to prepare to rescue the woman.\\nPolice officers continued to reassure the woman, asking her to sit down and not jump.

She was graded as a low-risk missing person. Information gathered from the search was input onto an MPS missing person record. Not all of the information provided to the response officers by the family during the search was recorded. In addition, certain information provided by the woman’s brother during his initial phone call to police was not reviewed by the officers, nor recorded onto the missing person record.\\nA further search of the woman’s home was conducted on 1 September and other investigative actions were carried out by MPS officers to locate her, including speaking to her friends and work colleagues. Her family began carrying out their own investigations, checking local shops for CCTV and viewing CCTV from their local underground station.\\nOn 7 September footage of the woman boarding a train towards Northampton on the day she went missing was viewed by her brother, who relayed this information back to the Detective Inspector (DI) responsible for the investigation. The DI did not obtain the CCTV, or pursue any line of enquiry arising from the footage showing her last known sighting.

However, the MPS assessed that the conduct of both responding officers could be dealt with by way of unsatisfactory performance procedures (UPP). This would be for their failure to record relevant information, and the failure to provide the woman’s family with a form detailing what had been seized from their home.
